It does have a cinnamon flavor, but is also innocuous enough that it can be enjoyed when not in a cinnamon mood. Great as a small sweet snack, out of a ziploc bag, if looking to indulge and not ruin a diet. A lot of other cereals only fit for a specific craving -- Fruity Pebbles, for example, when wanting sherbet-sweet taste; Corn Flakes for a clean and simple savory taste. Cinnamon Toast Crunch, however, covers just about every category. Hint: Try mixing with smaller-grained, stronger-flavored cereals in one bowl. Ex: I sprinkle some Fruity Pebbles over a Cinnamon Toast Crunch bowl when I want a bit of fruity kick but don't want a lot of sickly-sweet fruit-flavored milk left in the bowl. Cocoa flavored rice krispie-type cereals adds just a hint of cocoa and the additional crunch isn't detectable.

92,3081,3081,Kitty,4,"So hard to imagine cereals before Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Days when your cereal options were either you ate the nutrional things your grandparents love or you eat the pound of sugar the cereal Mascot was promoting. There was bland, sugar, or fruit. Then something came along your mom thought would help her avoid cooking French Toast or Pancakes. Something claiming to be better then her recipe and take minutes to dump on you so she could get you to school faster and so that she could get more sleep. I would not say pouring this cereal into your bowl under a cup of cold milk could at all similate mom's hot heart felt French Toast. There isn't that taste of butter,.. or eggs,.. or Pam. But this sure was a change in taste, suddenly a sweet cinnamon was a cereal option in the sugary, fruit, bran world of cereal. I just wonder one thing,.. why does the Mascot seem to disappear from the box or commercials some times? Okay, also.. what happened to his bakery pals? Are they working on their own Pancakes and Waffles cereals? The Cinnamon and Sugar are true in taste for this, so avoid this if you are allergic to Cinnamon. Some studies indicate a little Cinnamon may be good for your health, so no need to avoid if you are having health problems [ I am not a doctors and studies are constantly changing results]. If you want to really taste Cinnamon instead of Cinnamon Sugar, I would recommend Cinnamon life. This cereal gets soggy too quickly and it's Mascot(s) vanish(es) too often. It does not have namesake if you eat your French Toast at home but some resturants serve a very similar tasteing Cinnamon French Toast. This may surprise you as a finger or dry food, capable of mesmerizing children once they get it in their mouth ( have something to drink ready). Some people and resturants also use Cinnamon Toast Crunch as a secret ingredients in deserts. If you are a person that likes to be left alone and not eat out I'd give this a 3.5. If you eat out at all, have children, or are a child I'd give this a 4. Just eat a little at a time when using milk to avoid the sogginess.",72,0.1381396771818726,0.9391,0.5386198385909363

Most sites want you to buy multiple boxes to further increase their sales volume. Pursuit of the old profit bug-a-boo I guess. Gross more dollars and to heck with other peoples problems. Of course supply and (especially) demand could contributed to some availability problems. But thanks to grandma and grandpa AND to mom and pop, kids of this and the previous generation has been liberally inundated with all of the readily available sweet and sugar covered things one sees in stores these days.

There have been a few cereals to try a large blend, but after I had this I did not care for them any more. The market shelves seemed to reflect this as well. My surprise was the time it took them to have such a variety as they do now. You could accept it was younger, newer, and not available in all grocery stores yet for years. But by the time we passed 2000 most stores around me had dumpped similar products, even finding it impossible to make mimics with their value brands.

It doesn't get soggy fast but it still can get soggy. I would give it a five but I know the taste isn't perfect ten, there also isn't a cereal mascot so until recently I would have considered it's box and advertiseing a three. However, now the company employees are feeling like the mascots and they finally added some varity. The appearence should be about 3-3.5 but the Factory Workers are doing their job. The experience of eatting would work as a 5 but small children and people with certain allergies may not enoy. I'd balance that out to 4-4.75 depending on the person. But since I can't vote that way, I've given then 4 out of 5. I would describe each type of Honey Bunches of Oats differently.

I cannot think of anything else providing the same experience when chewing, as you have such a mix of rough crunchy clusters that you bite through but land into a padding of either soft or fragile flakes.

351,20914,20914,Kitty,4,"Description & Rating: I'm very picky and this was a cereal I loved. It has a touch of fruit or tang to it but that wasn't strong. It had a calm sweetness that stuck out but it wasn't overwhelming. It was so enjoyable, I would prefer to eat Nerds Cereal then I would Nerds. The experience of taste were alike to that of eatting a Nerd, it was sweet with a touch of tang, but not identical and perhaps reversed as Nerds have a strong tang that hits you while it was the sweetness that struck you while eatting this Cereal. I am giving it 4 out of 5 because I try to imagine it against other cereals and people's expectations. Many mascot cereals have sour marshmellows.. this leaves an impression. The box of mascot cereals are usually of a Cartoon Character or Person and their face consumes most of the box, Nerds cereal did not do this, infact it was some times hard to explain they were turely connected to the candies. With that you also lack those cuddly and collectable feelings you get when you see that family face of Mickey Mouse or Rainbow Brite calling you in. So the sum of this is Nerds Cereal had the problem of focusing more on something edible then on something you just buy because of the trend. Oh, how much I loved this cereal. I still find myself roaming the Cereal aisle talking about it. It makes for difficult trivia online,.. so even there I still speak of it. I do have to agree with Drecky. I did know some people that the Cereal did not agree with. Today I would suspect the Food Dye. I have problems explaining to people that Food Dye is not magic colors but comes from plants. I do not know if this was the cause but it's just a suggestion. If Nerds was to return, I might give it a 5/5. I would have to warn people it is like Cookie Crisp and Reese' Puff Cereal. Though it is modeled after Nerds Candy, it is a unique taste. It is also unlike any other cereal so I can not compare it's taste to any other.",252,0.1381396771818726,0.9481,0.5431198385909364

Luckily I live minutes from Canada in the US, but I can't understand why they've never tried selling it here. Stays crunchy in milk, tastes great, somewhat healthy. Just got like 10 more boxes on the last trip. Gonna be interesting if border patrol stops me and finds a bunch of Vector one of these days.",384,0.4671028078772243,0.9563,0.7117014039386121
