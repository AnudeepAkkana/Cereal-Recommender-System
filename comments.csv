trottersan,5.0,"Alpha-Bits were in my top 5 cereals of all-time. Not too sweet, but so delicious. In recent years it has reappeared, but is nothing like the original. Tastes like cardboard now. Not even a hint of sweetness. So sad. Since they started making so many cereals 'healthier', most just don't do it for me anymore. Sadly, the change to 'healthier' foods has sacrificed the original taste of these foods. Had McDonald's fries yesterday and they were inedible! It's like that with so many foods now.",11.0,,,
LuckyCharms#1,2.0,It's simple - Alpha Bits is Lucky Charms with no charms. Add the Marshmallows. Don't know why they won't.,11.0,,,

Nemo38,2.0,This rating is for the 'New and improved' Alpha Bits. This cereal disappeared for a few years and when it finally re-emerged they had changed the recipe so much that it was like eating cardboard. Smart company's don't change a good thing.

Yumarama,4.0,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was ""THE"" staple cereal at our house; you could almost always find a box of this available. I've gone and grabbed a box now and then in the last couple decades and can't believe how sweet these things are, and as I assume they'd have had even more sugar back in the 60's, it boggles my mind why my mother would have bought this. However, it still offers a good bit of nostalgia and I may pick up another box sometime, when I can get a bank loan. Man, cereals are expensive now-a-days...",11.0,,,
Grant Schinto,0.0,"I'm Gene Schinto's son. Congratulations. You're one of the few web sites to get anything factually right about my dad's involvement with naming Post cereals and Linus The Lionhearted characters. I'm impressed. By the way, my dad also named the cereal ""Crispy Critters"" and hence invented the now common slang term used by military, law enforcement and firefighters all over America. I didn't even know that until the past decade.",11.0,,,
VEG HEAD,1.0,"I give Alpha-Bits of the past 5 stars. Sadly, I give Alpha-Bits of 2014 a total of 0 stars. They must have changed the recipe, as they have a bitter aftertaste now. YUCK!",11.0,,,
Disappointed,1.0,"Shoot. I got excited. I finally found Alpha Bits in a store. So I bought two boxes of them because they were always my favorite cereal, but I could no longer find them in stores. Yuk! They were horrible! Just discovered they have a new recipe. I wish I had only bought one box. Instead, I'm throwing away two boxes! Awful!",11.0,,,
Disappointed,1.0,"New Alpha Bits are absolutely awful. Please return to the original formula. No one is buying them. Why mess with success. At least Coca Cola realized their error and returned Classic Coke after ""improving"" their product.",11.0,,,
EMA,1.0,"Recently had a craving for Alpha Bits, bought a box and yuck! They have a nasty rotten after taste. The remaining cereal was fed to the chickens. Thankfully, the recipe for eggs does not change.",11.0,,,
Andy,1.0,"This cereal used to be amazing, but they changed the recipe in August 2012 and it now tastes miserable. I'm sad that Post didn't keep it as is. If you want the old Alpha-Bits taste, don't go expecting what you're used to.",11.0,,,

Disappointed2,2.0,"Just bought a new box of Alpha-Bits. They didn't taste good - kind of a strong, bitter flavor. My daughter asked what was wrong with the Alpha-Bits. I figured a recipe change. Guess I was right. So sad, it was my favorite cereal.",11.0,,,
They Changed!,1.0,"I looked all over a few weeks ago for Alpha bits as my favorite store was bought out by a bigger store and they didn't carry them. So I find them at Target and I'm THRILLED. I buy 3 boxes. After eating them I go back to said Target and buy 3 more boxes only to find out they TASTE HORRIBLE!!! I called Post and they changed the recipe in August 2012. Just a few weeks ago! My newest boxes are the ""new"" formula. There is NO warning or indication whatsoever that anything has changed but they told me that sugar went from 10 grams to 6 grams! Grains doubled. They increased the Iron and took out something that stimulates brain growth in kids. I'm incensed! I want the ""old"" Alpha Bits back! BTW, I'm 54! Still loving them. WAS still loving them. -D",11.0,,,
MadMonkey,0.0,(Team Breakfast Member) Does anyone remember this cereal also having a marshmallow version? It was the only one I liked... it came in a purple box not blue. Note From Mr Breakfast: Hi Madmonkey - The cereal you're looking for was Marshmallow Alpha-Bits.,11.0,,,
stalley,0.0,Anybody remember when Post has a numbers cereal that corresponded with the letters of Alpha-Bits? Loved them both. They helped me be excited about learning numbers and letters when I was a little sprout. I'm surprised they don't market this cereal and an edible learning tool.,11.0,,,

DuckyStu,5.0,"Alpha Bits have been my most favorite cereal for so many years. It was so disappointing when it disappeared from the shelves. My parents used to buy it by the case and so did I... literally. Then Post teased us with a very limited run a couple of years back, then took it away again... Aaaarrrggg!!!",11.0,,,
ageless kid,5.0,"It was great that the Walmart in my town carried Alpha-Bits for the first time in recent times. The best thing that I remember about Alpha-bits was the ""crazy shapes"" they added in the mid 1960's.",11.0,,,
Jane Doe,5.0,"Not sure I'm going to like the ""new"" version. Why alter an original classic? Darn... and I was looking so forward to finally find somewhere that still sells Alpha Bits! Stores in my area don't carry this anymore, in ANY variety.",11.0,,,

Tanner T.,0.0,"To Ruffin: if you find it, post it. I've been looking for the alphabits commerical too.",11.0,,,
Ruffin,0.0,"Does anyone have a copy of the commercial that introduced brown sugar frosting? It featured a speech choir for audio and simple line drawing animation in the form of wavy vertical lines and mouths. The text went something like this: A: Have you heard what's new? B: What's new? What's new? A: The brand new taste of Alpha-Bits. They're brown sugar frosted. B: Brown sugar frosted? A: Brown sugar makes these crispy letters, made from oats, golden. New golden Alpha-Bits are better than ever. B: Why are they better? A: 'cause brown sugar makes 'em that way. B: What way? A: Crisp, golden, and delicious. Now Alpha-Bits are more A-B-C-Delicious than ever. Than ever! And new golden Alpha-Bits have energy, from A to Z. You'll like 'em better than cereals with white sugar on 'em. Start your day a little bit better, A-B-C-Deliciously. Now you know what's new, don't you? B: Sure--Alpha-Bits. They have a new golden color and a brand new taste. All: Now the only cereal with all the letters is the only cereal with brown sugar on 'em. New golden Alpha-Bits are better than ever. Than ever!",11.0,,,
joebacon,4.0,(Team Breakfast Member)  I can still remember the original Jack E Leonard commercials where a dog was chasing him up a tree and the postman kept tossing Alpha Bits at the dog.

wickywicky76,1.0,(Team Breakfast Member)  Wow!!! :( How did they take the greatest cereals of all time and turn them to garbage and still label and market them as if they actually have any quality worth wasting one penny on? What once tasted like blueberry now tastes exactly the same as the strawberry which tastes exactly like the chocolate. All the monster cereals taste the same. If I close my eyes I couldn't tell which one I was eating. All of them are flavorless and the milk doesn't even change to match the color of the cereal like it used to. This is an insult to the past memories of this ill fated block buster cereal..

Martymo,5.0,"The three highest vitamin dense cereals that I ever found were Total, Product 19 and Buc Wheats. According to the boxes Total and Product 19 both had 100% of most of the vitamins while Buc Wheats had 45% of the ""minimum daily adult requirement"" for most of the vitamins. However I thought the flavor of Buc Wheasts was superior to the others and as others have commented I sure wish it was available again.",47.0,,,

Fight4Buc,5.0,"In the early 1980's, my spouse & I really liked the original Buc Wheats cereal. We were really disappointed when it was discontinued. I had called General Mills in the 80's and 90's - telling them they should bring back Buc Wheats in its original recipe. The last time I called was 2001 and the General Mills customer service rep questioned if it wasn't another cereal company that made Buc Wheats. I told the rep to look it up on the web. How sad GM discontinued a really great cereal then they don't even know they made it in the first place.",47.0,,,

Rocks,5.0,"This was one great cereal. Only one I liked more than the sugar bomb cereals. Getting a clump of Buc Wheats on your spoon meant that maple goodness was about to explode.

Julie,5.0,"Great cereal. Loved when the flakes stuck together when too much maple coating was on it. I remember the deer picture they had on the back once; I think it had a log cabin behind the deer, with maybe four prints you could buy? And I remember they gave away (sold?) the Farmer's Almanac as a promotion for the cereal. It was 1977, and I still have a copy. It has the ""Pass the Buc"" advertisement on the back. And I remember once I accidentally put tomato juice on my Buc Wheats because my mom put tomato juice in the same pitcher that she usually put the reconstituted powdered milk in... It tasted awful, but as a dutiful daughter who didn't want to waste GREAT BUC WHEATS, I tried to eat it anyway. Maple and tomato don't mix... Don't ever try Buc Wheats that way!",47.0,,,

It was the flakes of cereal, some kinda binding agent and then Chocolate Chips with it. They were the bomb.

It was hard to find in grocery stores; there would be one row on the top shelf, harder to see, and not many stocked behind it; so if a few sold , it would be an empty shelf and nobody knew until the shelf was restocked, that there was Buckwheats there. It was never a highly marketed cereal. All the highly advertised cereals got the shelf space, so even though it was a great tasting cereal with a lot of people craving it, it probably didn't sell enough because of marketing and retailing (placement and stocking of product).

The little dried fruits and things are sweet and super tasty... And you know how when there's a variety of ingredients (like dried fruit, nuts, flakes, etc), there's always one or two things in the mix you don't like? Not Basic 4! Every single thing in the box is tasty! The flakes are lightly sweetened too, and have a really nice texture, much hardier than cornflakes. The milk at the bottom of the bowl is in my top 3 of cereal milks alongside Fruity Pebble milk and Cinnamon Toast Crunch Milk. Seriously. It can hang with the big boys. Try it at least once.

I am doing this rating based on the non-rice puff version of this cereal that I haven't had since 2016/2017 last. I loved it! It made me start my day right. The blueberries were sweet and tangy and went excellent with the granola clusters and abundant almonds. The flakes version is WAY better than the rice puff version. Blueberry Morning forever!",35.0,,,
dermat,2.0,Original cereal was my all-time favorite to eat. They destroyed the flavor of this cereal after refactoring it to make a bigger profit.

It now tastes like any other purely puffed rice cereal with little bits of dried blue berries added. I loved the old Great Grains mixture of grains, crunch and multiple tastes they created. Now it just tastes like puffed rice with no crunch. You can buy any puffed rice cereal at a lower cost per unit.",35.0,,,

cyclone,5.0,Blueberry Morning is awesomely delicious. I love the firm chewy blueberries. The granola clusters are a fantastic addition. I can' believe Post doesn't make it available.

captain a7,5.0,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I may remember having the Star Wars cereal since I've been a huge star wars fan. It happens to be my other favorite movie along with my other favorite movies like Godzilla and Willow. And my favorite characters happen to be Luke Skywalker Boba Fett, Chewbacca, C3-PO and R2-D2 and it reminds me of He-man and Transformers. I also like Darth Vader. I would have a special dinner when I would watch both of the movies. Return of the Jedi is one of the best ones and playing the arcade game and the other video games is like being in the galaxy.

Little Mike,5.0,Our grandma introduced us to it but she wouldn't let us eat very much. Maybe we were too husky and it was too rich. Or maybe it was too expensive to waste on little kids. But we loved it. I've often wondered what was in it. What germ?,1143.0,,,
BevCal72,5.0,"I loved this cereal. If I didn't want a bowl-full with milk, I would sprinkle it on a piece of toast with honey and cinnamon. I liked its flavor and crunch and would love to see it come back in organic and non-GMO style if possible.",1143.0,,,
Kim,5.0,The ONLY cereal I ate growing up. I was a very finicky eater and the dr suggested this cereal to my mom before he removed my tonsils to build up the iron in my blood. I was six and continued eating it into my twenties when Kellogg's quit making it! Loved the taste and still miss it.,1143.0,,,
Gman,5.0,Delicious and nutritious. As an occasional desert my mother would serve it with half and half cream. That was a succulent desert that I wish I could serve to family members now just because it's so delicious and full of nutrients.,1143.0,,,
Jacqui,5.0,My favorite of all time. I emailed them to see if they will ever bring it back.,1143.0,,,

Momfromaz,5.0,Best cereal in the world. Still miss it after all these years.,1143.0,,,
Postman,5.0,I thought the same thing Summergal. Not sure what it could be but it is holding them back from reintroducing the cereal. It is such a shame as this could be a big seller.,1143.0,,,
Summergal,5.0,I think they won't bring it back because they had something 'addictive' in it! (Probably not legal these days!!!). I still crave this cereal over 55 years later!! And I can't walk down a cereal aisle without looking for it. I would pay BIG BUCKS to buy some more. Who do I need to bribe? :-),1143.0,,,

Trey B.,5.0,I've thought about this cereal many times over the years. I don't care about the size of the flakes or even the 'nutritive values'. It was the best tasting cereal ever. It would be a treat if someone could duplicate that great taste and bring it to market.,1143.0,,,

Deb,5.0,"I, too, am constantly dreaming of and wishing for Concentrate to return to the shelves. I ate it for years and can still taste it and feel the texture in my mouth. It was heavenly. I wish Kellogg's would read all the posts about the love of this product and, like someone else said, start making it again or sell the recipe to someone who will. Maybe we should approach them and try to buy it - then get a group of us together to set up and plant.",1143.0,,,

Rolo in Boulder,5.0,"I cannot tell you how much I loved Kellogg's Concentrate. It was the cereal I always chose, whether at home or away. I ate it for years. I'm now 65 and I still really miss it! I wonder what cereal comes closest to its taste? Anyone have a suggestion? I think if you let Grape Nuts get soft in the milk, it has a little bit of a similar flavor. Please Kellogg's, PUT CONCENTRATE BACK ON THE SHELVES!",1143.0,,,

NightWriter,5.0,"Every once in awhile, I do an internet search, hoping someone would post the 'recipe' for Concentrate, like people have done for Orange Julius, etc. The big C was the cereal that got me through my undergrad years!

CallmeDory,5.0,Do you have a recipe for Concentrate? What it's made of? Can it be made at home?,1143.0,,,
Postman,5.0,"Mr. Breakfast. I think sometimes the ones doing multiple votes are trying to hurt certain cereals. In other words, the voter who voted 30 times for Concentrate does not like Concentrate and is trying to purposely get them to be penalized. I have seen this with other cereals also.

L.B.,5.0,"Awesome cereal. I called Kellogg's once about it - they had no idea what I was talking about. So glad to see it here. There has been nothing like it since. My mother loved it - a 'healthy' eater but I liked it too. But once milk was poured... within a minute or so, paste. I remember my mother treated it as special because it was expensive. Back then cereal was considered cheap so maybe that's why it didn't sell well enough. Sighhhhh... awesome cereal... think that little gold foil box expensive cereal would go over GREAT now - instant cult favorite. World has changed. Heck - there's Starbuck's.",1143.0,,,

Kundry,5.0,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I have fond memories of this cereal as a kid growing up in the 60s. I wasn't aware that the serving size was supposed to be so small.

We were competing with the Soviets after all and the fate of the free world depended on how well we did on President Kennedy's physical fitness test!

Nick #One,4.0,"Yeah I remember this cereal very well. It was pretty tasty and in such a small box that it seemed unreal. It had a way of swelling up so much that it was equivalent to cereal from a larger box. There must be a good reason why Kellogg's does not bring it back. It probably has to do with whatever ghastly trick they pulled to get it to shrink and expand so much with just milk. Like maybe they added worm castings, mycorrhizae and water-obsorbing polymers. You have to know there was a lot less control over what kinda crap they put into food in those days.",1143.0,,,

Marymouse,5.0,"Concentrate was a staple in our home and certainly would be again if it would become available. I paid the extra price back then so as to give our children something truly nutritious as compared to the worthless array of other cereals on the store shelves. Our kids, all in their 40s now, still remember it fondly and wish it would have been available for their children. We Baby Boomers do have some buying power and would relish the reintroduction of this product, even if sold only in health food or specialty stores. If sold online, we'd be ordering it by the case and introducing it to our grandchildren. Also, children who grew up with this amazing cereal would greatly welcome its return. NOW IS THE TIME, KELLOGG'S, WHILE FOLKS STILL REMEMBER THIS GREAT PRODUCT! With the current obesity epidemic, I wonder why cereal companies continue to pollute the store shelves with so much sugary junk rather than something truly nutritious. The almighty dollar reigns, I guess!",1143.0,,,

The only bad thing I could say was that it was a very small box for the price, but devoted fans won't mind that. I miss it so much that I have tried in vain to find a replacement from Quaker, Cascadian Farms, and even Sunbelt. Please, please, please bring back the CW Post cereal that we all know and love. Trust me, you will have no problem selling it this time around. Older people who remember it from before, will be hoarding CW Post by the truckload this time.

When they found it they would buy it by the carton if possible and send it home to me.

All our neighbors - kids were chewing that stuff - ""on dry"" without milk - Tomorrow: there were no more of it in whole town. I remember that one, older, guy from my street teased us: ""are you eating WC post?"". I was told that to my budds in school, coll. and unvrs. but no one remember it.

bursar20,5.0,"(Team Breakfast Member)  GREAT for just about any craving. Sweet, but not too sweet. Can EASILY be eaten just out of the box. It does have a cinnamon flavor, but is also innocuous enough that it can be enjoyed when not in a cinnamon mood. Great as a small sweet snack, out of a ziploc bag, if looking to indulge and not ruin a diet. A lot of other cereals only fit for a specific craving -- Fruity Pebbles, for example, when wanting sherbet-sweet taste; Corn Flakes for a clean and simple savory taste. Cinnamon Toast Crunch, however, covers just about every category. Hint: Try mixing with smaller-grained, stronger-flavored cereals in one bowl. Ex: I sprinkle some Fruity Pebbles over a Cinnamon Toast Crunch bowl when I want a bit of fruity kick but don't want a lot of sickly-sweet fruit-flavored milk left in the bowl. Cocoa flavored rice krispie-type cereals adds just a hint of cocoa and the additional crunch isn't detectable. And, if really looking for a cinnamon punch, sprinkle a bit of cinnamon powder directly into the milk bowl.",72.0,,,

Kitty,4.0,"So hard to imagine cereals before Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Days when your cereal options were either you ate the nutrional things your grandparents love or you eat the pound of sugar the cereal Mascot was promoting. There was bland, sugar, or fruit. Then something came along your mom thought would help her avoid cooking French Toast or Pancakes. Something claiming to be better then her recipe and take minutes to dump on you so she could get you to school faster and so that she could get more sleep. I would not say pouring this cereal into your bowl under a cup of cold milk could at all similate mom's hot heart felt French Toast. There isn't that taste of butter,.. or eggs,.. or Pam. But this sure was a change in taste, suddenly a sweet cinnamon was a cereal option in the sugary, fruit, bran world of cereal. I just wonder one thing,.. why does the Mascot seem to disappear from the box or commercials some times? Okay, also.. what happened to his bakery pals? Are they working on their own Pancakes and Waffles cereals? The Cinnamon and Sugar are true in taste for this, so avoid this if you are allergic to Cinnamon. Some studies indicate a little Cinnamon may be good for your health, so no need to avoid if you are having health problems [ I am not a doctors and studies are constantly changing results]. If you want to really taste Cinnamon instead of Cinnamon Sugar, I would recommend Cinnamon life. This cereal gets soggy too quickly and it's Mascot(s) vanish(es) too often. It does not have namesake if you eat your French Toast at home but some resturants serve a very similar tasteing Cinnamon French Toast. This may surprise you as a finger or dry food, capable of mesmerizing children once they get it in their mouth ( have something to drink ready). Some people and resturants also use Cinnamon Toast Crunch as a secret ingredients in deserts. If you are a person that likes to be left alone and not eat out I'd give this a 3.5. If you eat out at all, have children, or are a child I'd give this a 4. Just eat a little at a time when using milk to avoid the sogginess.",72.0,,,
PeaPants,5.0,"This is my favorite cereal ever. I tried the new cinnamon total that you say is similar, but it's not nearly as good. C.T.C. Forever!",72.0,,,

For some reason, I've had Cocoa Puffs on my mind for the last few days or so. I've decided to buy some the very next time in in the food store! I'm also going to buy a GALLON of cold, fresh CHOCOLATE milk to go with my them - never tried it before, but I'm now OBSESSED with the idea! When I was little, I loved this cereal and I loved cold chocolate milk - what in the UNIVERSE could be better than Cocoa Puffs in cold chocolate milk?! It's the VERY BEST cereal of ALL TIME.

GENX knows best,1.0,"Corn Pops used to be my favorite cereal when it was in the foil bag during the 80's and 90's. So, all I can say is... Corn Pops sucks now. No flavor, stale texture, hard kernels. Yuck. I buy them a couple of times a year hoping the recipe will change back. This was the last time. I'm literally returning the box to Kroger. I'd rather eat cardboard. Why did Kellogg's have to change a good thing? Cry. This generation changes everything that was once good. Cry.",94.0,,,
ex-corn pop fan,1.0,"Wow, what a disappointment. This used to be my favorite cereal. I was looking forward to the corn sweetness and got neither.

Way to go Kellogg's, you murdered one of your long time favored products.",94.0,,,
SugarKenny,2.0,"Longtime cereal addict here. Corn Pops used to be one of my childhood favorites. The last couple of boxes I've bought recently in 2018 seem to be bland. But even worse, some of the small pops in the box are hard as rocks, and would literally crack your tooth if you tried to chew them. I guess I'm never buying these again. Another one bites the dust, along with the supposedly ""new & improved"" Alpha Bits which I'm also never buying again :(",94.0,,,

Used 2B Good,2.0,"Ugh, so I hadn't had this cereal for a really long time. Still, I remember exactly what Corn Pops, then Sugar Corn Pops tasted like. I recently got a box for my kids to try and I started to wonder if I was losing my sense of taste. Gone is any corn taste. The kernels are much smaller than they used to be, and randomly some of them are very hard, even in milk. I'm wondering if they started making it with feed/field corn. I was struggling to taste anything at all besides some sweetness... the only thing I could pick up was a hint of soap. I don't know what they did to Corn Pops but whatever they did, it isn't good.",94.0,,,

John D,3.0,I'm very disappointed with this cereal now. They apparently reduced the sugar (molasses) content sometime in the last few years or so and the taste is just not as good as it used to be.

K. Shadow,3.0,"Umm I am pretty sure 'dewey33' either never ate it a few years ago (before they changed the flavor), or he is a Kellogg propagandist! I was very disappointed but would not rate it as ""bad"" per-say.",94.0,,,
Cereal Girl,3.0,"It was my favorite cereal but I suspect they changed the formula after they added fiber. When they first added fiber it had a reddish tinge but it still tasted good.

They finally settled on Corny Snap, but they had no clue what it was. I'm guessing they thought they made it up. Then my teacher said that he was going to look up what a corny snap was, so I decided I would to. I had no clue it was a cereal! My friends told me it was what they used to call really bad farts. So, I'm glad its a cereal because I would hate to be named after a fart. and that's my story... please rate 1-5 how you liked it. Btw, it really did happen to me.",100.0,,,

St.Micheal,5.0,I love Count Chocula cereal and it is one of my favorite monster based cereals. But I think they should bring back Fruit Brute! But I will always be a Count Chocula fan!,101.0,,,
Howard,4.0,"In the old version, the little pencil-eraser-shaped marshmallows exploded with flavor in your mouth, like little chocolate flavor crystals. The oat-corn pieces weren't that sweet. Chocula is still pretty good under the new ""formulation"", but the new Frankenberry is EXTREMELY disappointing compared to the old version. The strawberry taste of the old Frankberry was magical; it's just strawberry-flavored Lucky Charms now.",101.0,,,
E.E.,1.0,"I bought Count Chocula and Frankenberry a few years ago and they tasted horrible. I loved them when I was a kid and I knew there was something different about them. Now, I know from reading these comments that they no longer use oats to make the cereals and replaced it with corn. Bad marketing idea for those of us who remember the classic taste from the 80s.",101.0,,,
Postman,5.0,I saw a box of Count Chocula at Kmart. Looked at the back of the box and it said this year there are 5 monster cereals available. There were pictures of Fruit Brute and Yummy Mummy along with Frankenberry and Booberry. I only saw Count Chocula at Kmart though. Maybe Walmart or Target will carry the others. Now if they would just make it in the oat based like it originally was.,101.0,,,

selfdo,0.0,"This cereal was parodied by Matt Groening twice: First, in the Simpsons, at one point when Montgomery Burns deigns to go to the ""food jobber"" to get some grub for himself, he scrutinizes a box of Count Chocula and puts it in his basket, saying, ""Well, it looks like me..."". Some time later, a fave breakfast treat for Phillip J. Fry is Arch-Duke Chocula, presumably over 1000 years promoted from a lowly Count.",101.0,,,

Tommywriter,1.0,"If you were alive to eat this Cereal before the early 1990's, you'll quickly discover that this cereal is NOTHING like it was back in the 1980's. Back then, the cereal was a very lite chocolate oat cereal with CHOCOLATE tasting marshmallows in the shape of little squares. NOW this cereal is this glazed tasting oat crap that tastes like bad coco puffs, and the marshmallows are not even chocolate tasting. They taste like the marshmallows you would get out of Lucky Charms. Shame on you, General Mills for RUINING this once great cereal. And for those of you who want to know WHY they only sell it during the Halloween season, is because the SALES are DOWN because they CHANGED the cereal back in the early 90's to this crappy ""NEW"" taste. I feel sad for you young kids who never had the chance to taste this cereal when it was GOOD.",101.0,,,
IcedEarthaholic,5.0,"(Team Breakfast Member)  There are three words I use to describe this cereal... off the hook! You really can't go wrong with the Count, and yes Franken Berry and Boo Berry are usually back during this time of year at my local Target too.

Derekdespie,5.0,"(Team Breakfast Member)  We have learned from General Mills that ""Boo Berry"" (blueberry-flavoured), ""Count Chocula"" (chocolate-flavoured), and ""Franken Berry"" (strawberry-flavoured) are finally returning to grocery stores and other fine retailers anywhere across the whole nation around 2011, and almost every year, they'll be available between late August and early December. The 12 spooky-fun marshmallow shapes will be contained in all three Monster-themed breakfast cereals, except that they come in each flavor, just like the corn cereal pieces are in that same shape of each one. General Mills' ""Monster Triple Pack"" breakfast cereal will be finally available in fewer U.S. retailers nationwide - including Walmart, Target, Costco, and a couple of others. It will contain three bags of different Monster-themed breakfast cereals, and will also be available between late August and early December every year.",101.0,,,
Brandiiiiii,5.0,"I have very found memories of this cereal. I loved it when I was little! I loved the whole name of Count Chocula and the cereal tastes good to.

Tray,5.0,"My favorite cereal as a child, and still is today as an adult. Nowadays, I find Count Chocula around October in time for Halloween at my local Target store, but I was able to find it at a Shoprite in June. It'll always be my favorite chocolate cereal.",101.0,,,
Jessica,5.0,"My all time favorite cereal, it's a shame I can only find it around Halloween, the rest of the year I have to make due with the generic versions Chocolate Marshmallow Mateys (Malt-o-meal) and Chocolate Marshmallow Cosmos (Kroger).

CactusHeart,5.0,"The greatest junk cereal on the market today. It's got it all: the multi-shaped marshmallow-y fun of lucky charms, but instead of lucky charms' bland oat pieces, it's got bits with all the chocolatey goodness of cocoa puffs. And though it's companion cereals boo berry and franken berry are also good, count chocula uses REAL COCOA FLAVOR unlike boo and franken, which uses all artificial flavoring. I would eat this cereal every day if I could. Put that down as part of my last meal *LOL*",101.0,,,
Cabin,5.0,"I'm curious to know when this cereal changed its formula -- I seem to remember as a kid that it wasn't nearly as hard on the roof of my mouth as it is now! Does anyone else remember this? It seems now to be more puffed with air and coated in something, whereas when I was young it was more like the cereal pieces in Lucky Charms -- just chocolate.",101.0,,,

Kaboom was on sale big time, since no one was buying it, and my mom bought like 5 cases of it, 100 boxes or so. I ate Kaboom cereal every day for a year and my mom would not buy any more cereal until it was gone. So while it was nasty, tasted like a bottle of natural vitamins but looked colorful, I have fond memories of it since I looked at that box every morning for at least a year of my childhood.

MamaLisa52,5.0,(Team Breakfast Member)  One of the best cereals ever - right up there with Quisp. I like Rocky and Bullwinkle too. Kaboom failed in comparison and Quisp and King Vitaman didn't stain your clothes or the kitchen floor or furniture if you dropped a wet piece on it like Kaboom did. It could stain concrete and it did. If you dropped Kaboom on the patio or kitchen floor the stain from the food coloring was there for weeks or months if didn't wipe it up that second.

Kellogg's was stupid for dropping this wonderful tasting cereal. I called the company and asked one of their ""agents"" why this cereal was dropped. I was told, ""It wasn't a good seller."" Really? Everybody I hung out with back then had a box of Krumbles in their pantry. Kellogg's is run by nitwits. Look at the crapola they produce now... pure sugar with different names. Wheat Chex is a fair substitute for Krumbles, but even Wheat Chex doesn't have the rich flavor of Krumbles. BTW, they wouldn't give me their recipe. If I could get my hands on that recipe, I'd invest every cent I have and produce the cereal myself... and make a fortune on that cereal alone.

I have continued my mother's tradition of making them, substituting Kellogg's All-Bran for the Krumbles. Not as tasty, but the shape works. This year I used a combination of All-Bran and General Mills Fiber One... the variety shaped like Krumbles, NOT flakes. Melt 3/4 pound of chocolate (combination of milk and unsweetened, or semi-sweet and bittersweet, whatever you like). Melt over hot water, stir till smooth. Put 3 cups of the dry cereal in a big bowl, pour the melted chocolate over. Stir gently till cereal is all coated. On waxed paper, shape into nests about 4"" across, with edges high enough to hold jelly beans. When the nests are dry and set, fill with the beans. Wrap in plastic wrap.

I am a retired vet, so I've asked everywhere I've went except overseas. Mapo is the best. I'd eat it over oatmeal any day :)",234,,,
patricegreene,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I remember when they made the one that came with the syrup in the box. You were able to pour the colored syrup in your oatmeal. I wish they could bring that back out. It was the early 90's.,234,,,
jottieofhouston,5,The greatest!!!,234,,,
bobchance,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Maypo is also versatile for other uses (additions, etc). Good nutrition and price.",234,,,
tyson114baby,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) Back time my time Maypo is and has been my favorite cereal I ever ate, now were I live at for the past 25 years there is none (Puerto Rico) sometime one of my friend go to the state and when he come back he brings my 20 boxes of Maypo, I share it with friends and family. They say they never ate Maypo but they love the smell and taste they enjoy it. Is to bad that none of the stores sell it hear. Thank you Mr. Maypo for the cereal that I enjoy to eat at anytime.",234,,,
freetoyinside,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  In the late 50's MAYPO I like every other, victim of Madison avenue, kid in America wanted his MAYPO. At the time it sure beat cream of wheat and Oatmeal. I was allowed to even add a little Log Cabin maple syrup to my Maypo. Back when Log Cabin was maple and not corn syrup.",234,,,
Sharon G,5,"I also grew up on Maypo and rediscovered as an adult. Although difficult to find in stores, NJ & New England states should have it. I use it in recipes as well... Bran Muffins... yum. You guys need a massive ad. campaign... QUAKER CAN'T COMPETE...",234,,,
peggy,5,I grew up on Maypo and I would have liked my kids to grow up with it too. My little brother and I were talking about how you can't find it any where. I guess I'll have to go through Amazon.,234,,,
jerry002,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My Father was stationed at Ft Devens just out of Fitchburg Ma, where I went to Jr. High and High School. I lived on Nashua St. just off Water St. As my Mother also worked, I was often sent to a local corner grocery store, there I fell in love with Maypo and Tomato Sausage. I joined the military myself in 1962 and haven't been back to the area again. I haven't been able to find either product since. Please excuse any mistakes I am a retired disabled Viet Nam veteran and some times don't get everything right.",234,,,
Robbie N.,5,"I grew up on Maypo and loved every bowl of it, when ever I would spend the night with my aunt my parents would have to send the box with her, it's wonderful.",234,,,

Avacarho,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I love Mini Trix and I'm an adult. I found them at my local Kmart one day and fell in love at how much is in the box and bowl after I've poured some. They remind me of Nerds candy. When I add milk, they stick to each other, and the flavor is awesome. Please keep this on the store shelves, and get them to Walmart. I've checked at my local Walmart Supercenter, and they don't carry them, nor had ever heard of them. If I have to I'll keep stopping at Kmart on my way home from Walmart just to get my Mini Trix fix. Btw, please make Mini Cocoa Puffs, too.",1579,,,
mimspirate,0,This is the ONLY cereal my grandson will eat. I can't find it on the store selves anywhere. I even like the taste. Can I order this cereal? If so where?,1579,,,

FondaPetting,5,FINALLY! A version of Trix that doesn't tear up my mouth.,1579,,,
DJ Bluntz,1,"I 100% agree with the comments about it having no crunch. It gets way, way too mushy. I also prefer the old Trix. They must know this cereal is a failure by now.",1579,,,
bookofsnow,5,I actually love it. (Surprised to see so many people hate it.),1579,,,
No More Trix,1,I will never buy this again! It's soggy and tasteless! It's terrible what they did to Trix!,1579,,,

B.R.U.V.,1,I have stopped buying Trix until they bring back the old Trix. I almost chocked on this soggy tasteless junk.,1579,,,
DynamiteHoney,1,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Trix was once my favorite cereal. It was the one cereal I have liked my entire life, that is WAS my favorite cereal until somebody screwed it up by putting those teeny tiny little cruddy things in a box and slapping a Trix Mini label on them. I HATE this crap and keep hoping and praying that the manufacturers will come to their senses and make it a decent size morsel again. These things get soggy and mushy before I can put my spoon in the bowl so I had to throw it all away. EVEN my dogs don't want this mushy yucky gross mass of goo.",1579,,,
Trix Defender,2,Hate it. Regular Trix only for me!,1579,,,
viko,5,I love these Mini Trix. I hope it stays available!,1579,,,
Weekender,1,"I look forward to my weekend bowls of Trix. Now I'm having to come up with something else. My half eaten box of mini Trix is staying on the pantry shelf. The texture is all wrong and the little pieces turn into soggy, gooey chunks when milk is added. Yuck!",1579,,,
Cindyloohoo,2,I greatly prefer the original Trix... stays crunchy longer. I also eat Trix dry as a snack and Mini pieces are too small to eat individually!,1579,,,
CerealAddict,4,I agree with @NoCrunch. Too mushy. I prefer the old Trix.,1579,,,
Ty2,5,"Unfortunately now days when they come out with an awesome cereal it's for a limited time and then discontinued. The Mini Trix is a keeper. I really miss Powdered Donutz cereal. I would like to see ""G"" bring it back, if not just for a limited time, with the same great texture and taste.",1579,,,
Bex,5,"I am a 62 year old Grammy of 4 boys. I have been enjoying Trix cereal for many years. When I noticed the new Trix Mini on the store shelf, I bought it. Now, I am in love with Trix Mini and the texture and taste... simply delicious... keep making them please.",1579,,,
No Crunch,2,The mini pieces get mushy too fast. No crunch at all. Total blah.,1579,,,
bruv,1,Bad idea. It is very easy to chock on. They have to get rid of this cereal.,1579,,,

Captain Jerry,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved that cereal when I was a kid! I really miss it, man it sure was good! I still have several magnets that came in the cereal boxes.

SNACKLOP,5,This was GREATEST cereal. Ever. Crackle was my favorite Rice Krispie dude!,231,,,
D. Letter,5,I loved this cereal! Please bring it back!,231,,,
Kelly,5,Please please bring them back.,231,,,
rocky,5,"Please, please bring them back!",231,,,
Snap,5,Bring them back now!,231,,,
mkrispie,5,The best cereal ever. Today I picked marshmallows out of another cereal to add to my Rice Krispies because I missed the real cereal so much!,231,,,
myren,5,This was a great cereal. Perfect mix or marshmallow and crisps.,231,,,
DokFrank,5,This cereal was perfect. Bland Krispies with a shot of sweet mixed in. The perfect combination. The crisp of the Krispies and the crunch of the hard marshmallow was also perfect. I ate these constantly.,231,,,
poppy p.,5,Loved it. Bring it back!,231,,,
MissMissy,5,"This is my all time favorite cereal. I will try the suggestion of adding the dehydrated cereal marshmallows to Rice Krispies but I do remember a flavor on the Krispies themselves, they seemed slightly sweet although maybe that was just the marshmallow dust. I'm wondering if adding the marshmallows to Frosted Rice Krispies would be closer to Marshmallow Krispies. Man, I wish they would just bring them back though.",231,,,
The Ritty,4,Great cereal. How long did it last? Because I remember eating it later in my childhood.,231,,,
Missing U.,5,"This was the best cereal ever produced. The marshmallows were JUST sweet enough to make each spoonful perfectly delightful. Aesthetically, it was nice to see a hearty bowl of Krispies dotted with dozens of pastel-colored marshmallows. I miss you, Marshmallow Krispies!",231,,,
UCCF,5,These were awesome. My absolute favorite as a kid.,231,,,
actyourage,5,Near perfect cereal. Right up there with Jean LaFoot's Cinnamon Crunch for most underrated cereal of all time.,231,,,
MeleaCarrie,5,"I had this favorite Kellogg's Cereal when I was growing up... Rice Krispies with little Marshmallows. I would really like it if they could bring that back in 2015! :) I have been talking about and thinking about how good that cereal was for years. I'm sure me and so many others would enjoy the taste even if it's a limited time offer! Thank You Very Much... Melea from Lexington, NC",231,,,
Marshmellow11,5,BEST ever. Taking the Lucky Charm marshmallow suggestion just to try it again. Thanks for the suggestion. If this ever came back I'd buy the entire pallet. Bring it back!,231,,,
marshkrisp4evr,5,Best cereal EVER!!,231,,,
wcbryan80,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This is definitely my all time favorite cereal that is no longer being made. I am shocked that Kellogg's ever quit making it, since all it consists of is their regular Rice Krispies with marshmallows added. Luckily, as of today, I have found a local store that sells containers of just marshmallows (just like the ones in a box of lucky charms). I made a bowl today and it tastes exactly like I remember them tasting in the 1980's, the only difference being the size of the marshmallow. But for something from my childhood that I haven't tasted in some 20 yrs, I would say the difference is totally nonexistent. I'm telling you, if you want a time machine via your morning bowl of breakfast cereal, buy you some of these loose marshmallows and add them to a bowl of regular Rice Krispies. It is silly to have to go to such lengths, but when you taste the final product I promise you won't be disappointed if you were as big a fan as I am of the original cereal. What I wouldn't give though for a re-release (even if for just a limited time) of this cereal, complete in retro mid to late 80's packaging.",231,,,
Strutz,5,"Oh yeah! Loved the Marshmallow Krispies. I feel like they were only around for a year, but it was my fav when I could get it. Hope it comes back again!",231,,,
Pepper O.,5,"Marshmallow Krispies was the BEST cereal ever. I'm tempted to get a box of Lucky Charms, pluck out the marshmallows and add them to Rice Krispies so I can try to replicate the flavor of my old favorite.",231,,,
Jackie 2.0,5,"Bring it back as it is far better than Lucky Charms. Kids love marshmallows and this cereal had a lot. This was my favorite cereal as a kid. Please bring it back, even for a limited time!",231,,,
BetC7,5,YES! Please bring it back! I have never been able to find another cereal like it!,231,,,
skizzo,5,Bring this cereal back. Please! It reminds me of being a kid! :-D,231,,,
C.B. Esse,5,Why have they not brought this cereal back? It was so good!,231,,,
Paula1955,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Would Kellogg's ever consider bringing this cereal back for a re-debut!!!???? PLEASE!!!,231,,,

bgibson135,4,Comment under review by Mr Breakfast. Should appear within 24 hours.,709,,,
Nanu,5,We will never understand why Kellogg's discontinued this cereal! When I would find it in a grocery store I would buy every box on the shelf just to make sure we had enough to last a month or two. We do NOT like the Frosted Mini Wheats... way too much sugar! Pleases reconsider making it again and take the surgery one off the shelves! Thanks!,709,,,
Kansaslass,5,I loved Frosted Raisin Mini Wheats... awesome as a cereal or snack. Bring it back.,709,,,
suzannet,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I will never in a million years understand how Kellogg's could discontinue such a fantastic cereal. The original unfrosted Mini Wheats with Raisins is my all time favorite cereal. I did try the frosted version a couple of years back and it was okay, but it is now also discontinued. No need for the sugar. The original is the BOMB!",709,,,
Rochelle,5,I don't understand why this cereal is no longer in the stores. Please bring it back! There's no other cereal that can take the place of Mini Wheats and Raisin.,709,,,
jh7,5,"I love these, both frosted and unfrosted! According to the Kellogg's web site (Sept. 2017), they are no longer being made. Raspberry is the only ""Touch of Fruit"" version still in production. :-(",709,,,
jt.shmee,5,Just about the best cereal ever. I miss them so much.,709,,,
Gizzard,5,Please bring them back. I can't find them anywhere and I LOVED them.,709,,,
Froglover,5,"I love this cereal. Why can't I buy it in Vero Beach, FL?",709,,,
anglehair,4,"Where can you buy this cereal in Youngstown, ME? My husband just loved it. We can't find it anywhere. Please help us out.",709,,,
Marshal CC,0,"A note to Kellogg's: Please consider bringing the un-frosted version back, as the raisins and fruit filled ones are already sweet enough. If you could just turn off the sugar coating when you are making these, I would gladly buy three cases of them. They were the best cereal around. I still buy Mini Wheats and sprinkle the raisins on them, but they just don't taste the same. Thanks, a loyal Kellogg's cereal buyer since 1959.",709,,,
Lola,5,They make Frosted Mini Wheats with Raisins now! I've seen them at my local supermarket and at Target. They're called Frosted Mini Wheats Touch of Fruit in the Middle (there are a few flavors including Raisin). They're pretty much the same cereal as Raisin Squares/Raisin Mini Wheats but with frosting on top.,709,,,
LadyJ,5,Wow. Just found them and these are great!!,709,,,
I. B. Diabetes,5,No need to add sugar when there's a raisin inside. Bring it back.,709,,,
Rochelle,0,"I used to eat Mini Wheats with raisins all through the day... even for late night snacks. I would wake up at night and eat some. When I bought them, I'd buy 3 or 4 boxes at a time.",709,,,
mittens,5,"Bring them back. I like Mini-Wheats, but I loved Mini-Wheats with Raisins.",709,,,
CDSD,5,I LOVED this cereal! I used to purchase 3 boxes at a time. The raisins were good for iron and the shredded wheat was good for heart-health. I have been searching for it for 7 years now. PLEASE bring it back! It was the only shredded wheat I liked.,709,,,
inacopina,5,Bring 'em back! Please and thank you!,709,,,
Clod Hopper,5,I loved the Mini-Wheats with Raisin inside. The mixed fruit one out now is good. But the simpler version with raisin was better.,709,,,
crissy k.,5,Raisin Mini Wheats were delicious. The best - much better than the frosted and the other Mini Wheats. I do not even eat cereal anymore since these Mini Wheats went away.,709,,,
Momof3,5,"The only cereal I could eat consistently for breakfast. Please, please bring it back. It is so much better than the ""raspberry"" one I just ate. Blech! Won't be buying that again.",709,,,
Mama,0,Mini-Wheats: Raisin? Where can these be found. I haven't seen them for years.,709,,,
Rose,5,I loved Mini-Wheats with raisins. Why did they stop making it?,709,,,
whynot,5,This is another cereal I miss. I LOVED this one.,709,,,
MiniRaisin Fan,5,"I agree with both of these comments and hope that Kellogg''s brings it back. One time when I asked I was told that they were reacting to customer desire for healthier breakfasts, but I think raisin mini wheat were one of the most healthy and tasty cereals I ever had.",709,,,
Cassie,5,"I love raisin mini wheats! Much better than the mixed berry-filled mini wheats they're coming out with now... those taste like a strawberry pop tart. I don't really see the need for fruit filling AND frosting. but, hopefully this will mean they're exploring other fruit fillings and will hopefully come back to raisin!",709,,,
SZNJ,5,Best cereal ever!! Kellogg's should bring it back!!,709,,,

Gretchen,5,"I loved it! I used to put it in my yogurt. So good, and I'm not a fan of things that taste like hearty wheat!",243,,,
Mr Cheery O.,5,"I was thinking about this cereal and how much I loved it as a kid. Based on all the nostalgic 5 bean (what is that icon?) ratings, I'm not alone.",243,,,
Deeskie,5,My very favorite ever. Wishing and hoping for a comeback. Why do they discontinue the good stuff. Frosting and marshmallows are good and nutritious for you? Shame on you Kellogg's!,243,,,
Warber,5,I so wish MOST would return to store shelves. Good memories of a great cereal.,243,,,
janey kate,5,Please bring back Most cereal!,243,,,
Mimi 2,5,"Most was tasty with milk and excellent as a crispy snack without milk. When it was off the shelves in a certain supermarket, I would walk for several blocks to another supermarket and clear their shelves of Most. Why was it ever discontinued? I'm still mourning the loss. Bring back Most cereal!",243,,,
star,5,Please bring back Most cereal. It was my fav!,243,,,
BigRob93,5,"As I kid, I too did not know these were so healthy... please bring 'em back!",243,,,
Tim,5,"My absolute most favorite cereal of all time! Yes, PLEASE, PLEASE bring it back! As a marathoner, it fulfilled my dietary needs perfectly. And the delicious flavor and texture... I still so clearly and fondly remember it all.",243,,,
flight777,5,"Glad I found this page. MOST was an exceptional cereal! I still remember eating it as a kid. Must have been the mid-80's? Great memories. Definitely my favorite 'serious' cereal. Very good (almost addictive) flavor and apparently pretty healthy too. It's hard to describe because it was so unique - the closet thing I can think of is a cross between Quaker Oatmeal Squares and Wheat Chex, only better than that sounds. Please bring this product back, or something like it... there aren't enough tasty, healthy cereals like this these days! David L. in Oregon.",243,,,
Grady,5,I ate Most Cereal everyday during the summer that I graduated from college. I really wish I could introduce it to my kids.,243,,,
Good One Gone,5,"I really loved this cereal too. I wish they would bring it back. For a while, I could find Unfrosted Mini Wheats which was close, but nowhere as good.",243,,,
Adam,5,"I absolutely loved this cereal. Never even knew it was ""nutritious"". Still can not understand why on earth, this awesome cereal was discontinued. It just makes no sense. How could something as bland as Cheerios become an American icon and this be cast aside?",243,,,
Still Mourning,5,...and one more time: PLEASE bring Most back!!,243,,,
Bugscuffle,5,Most was the best. Much better than anything in stores today. Please bring it back.,243,,,
JKMontana,5,"It was great! So much more interesting and tasty than other cereals with high fiber. Please, now that the population is aging, we need our MOST cereal back.",243,,,
Bismark,5,"I too loved Most cereal. I always look for it - especially when I'm in different parts of the country - just to see if it is still being made. I had my last box in 1985 when I had my first child. Yes, please bring it back Kellogg's.",243,,,
N. Harding,5,I have been looking for this cereal to make a comeback for about thirty years now. Please someone... anyone... make it come back again!,243,,,
I. B. Most,0,My last name is Most and I have never heard of this until now... I want to try it.,243,,,

Frankie,5,Our family really liked MOST cereal. wish they would bring it back. - Franks Family,243,,,

mary-5,5,I really loved Most cereal - wish it would come back.,243,,,
Chasse,5,I ate this during high school in the 80's and have been looking for it to come back for years. Best cereal ever! No other can compare.,243,,,
M. Dizzle,5,I also wish it would come back. No other cereal I've tried since has such a good texture and simple toasty flavor.,243,,,
Spuditt61,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I miss Most cereal. I loved that cereal. It needs to come back please.,243,,,

P.C.R.,5,It was my favorite cereal. I told my wife if this cereal came back I would probably start eating cereal again!,243,,,
Tundragirl,5,I am thrilled to see this post! Bring back Most!,243,,,
Dick,5,"Why was MOST so good? For those too young to remember, it was made like Chex, woven from shredded wheat but plumper. It was very high in fiber, sweetened only with molasses, which lowers blood pressure and is easier on the insulin-releasing pancreatic islet cells than refined sugar. It wasn't very sweet, and because it was made of shredded wheat, it was never too crunchy or too soggy. One can only speculate why the dorks at Kellogg's would ever end production of their all-time greatest product.",243,,,
Jerry,5,"The best cereal ever made. The only problem with it was that its box was too small, so you ran out of it too soon. Bring back MOST in a 24 ounce box or 48 ounce bag and even inveterate store brand buyers like me will buy it. Please!",243,,,
More Most Plz,5,Kellogg's are crazy for discontinuing this cereal. Look how many people loved it. This is nuts!,243,,,
Hungry4Most,5,This was one of the best tasting cereals that was also good for you. I'm not surprised to see I'm not the only person who wishes it were back on the store shelves. PLEASE!,243,,,
blitzcraig,4,"I, too, would like to see the return of Most cereal. My grandmother always had a box on hand, back in the day, and I ate it often as a kid.",243,,,
bummed in CB,5,Please bring back this cereal. I have not found one cereal that comes close to how tasty this breakfast food was. I really miss it. I would be very interested to know why Most cereal was discontinued. Pretty sad day when I no longer could find it on the grocery shelves :<,243,,,
phil,5,Hey Kellogg's.... please read this page and bring back Most cereal.,243,,,
cereallover27,5,I loved this cereal. I used to eat it in the summer with peaches on it and it was so delicious!,243,,,
SeeBee,5,I wish they would bring Most cereal back. It was one of my favorites.,243,,,
DramaLlama12321,0,This looks like an interesting cereal... I'm a bit young to have tried it though.,243,,,
SUNSHINE48,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This is the best cereal ever. My dad and I would sit and eat bowl after bowl of Most cereal... it was both of our favorite. I tried others, but nothing comes close to MOST. How can we get it back?",243,,,
HungryForMost,5,I too loved this cereal! Vitamin fortified and great taste. I used to eat it with a few tablespoons of sliced peaches and milk. Boy was that good! I need this cereal now today for a healthy morning breakfast. Please bring it back!,243,,,
dumplin,5,"This was one of my favorite cereals. Can I get it now? If yes, where?",243,,,
Meg,5,I ate this as I kid and loved it! It would be great if Most was brought back. It was delicious!,243,,,
elvis p.,5,Why was this cereal discontinued? I was addicted to it.....,243,,,
Harley,5,I have been looking all over for this cereal. I loved it and ate it twice a day and now I cant find it.,243,,,
jmills,5,I crave this cereal. It was the best and it should be brought back.,243,,,
mostlover,5,Wow! Thanks for uploading the picture. I've combed the Internet far and wide for any information about this classic taste. We should all call Kellogg's and start requesting that they give this cereal another run.,243,,,
D.M.S.,5,If they can't bring it back... do they have one that is similar?,243,,,
Trevoboe,5,This was a GREAT cereal! I've been searching the internet trying to make sure I didn't just imagine this cereal! Was it molasses that made it sweet?,243,,,
c.s.,5,"Yeah, I hate it when cereal manufactures pull great cereals like this one off the shelves. I think it was one of the higher priced cereals though.",243,,,
rkp,5,Most was my absolute favorite cereal ever. Kellogs should bring it back.,243,,,
The Egg,5,"This was my favorite cereal EVER!!! Arijin, I agree with you, it was so delicious but I can't even begin to describe it.",243,,,
Ekkaia,5,"This was my favorite cereal, it was the best! Why don't you make it any more?",243,,,
I.B.D.,5,This was the best cereal ever. Why is it not being made anymore?,243,,,
arijin,5,"I remember this as the most delicious cereal I have ever had, but it was so long ago, I couldn't begin to describe it.",243,,,
Ben,5,I used to absolutely love Kellogg's Most cereal. Do you know of a comparable cereal made today?,243,,,
Trappeprk,5,I reaaly miss Most. Great cereal. Kellog dropped the ball by discontinuing this product.,243,,,
comingonstrong,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I absolutely loved this cereal when it was on the market in the early to mid 80's. It had a uniquely nutty-yet-sweet taste unlike any other cereal before or since. It's mind-boggling why Kellogg's chose to discontinue it.,243,,,

LB Seely,5,I have enjoyed Muffets for decades. We have been living in the US for about 20 years and have especially enjoyed Muffets as a taste from home (southern Alberta). So very sad to hear they are gone from the market. I hope we can persuade Quaker to bring them back.,249,,,
Bozo,4,The Best!,249,,,
Carolina,5,Why was it not advertised more as a nutritious cereal? Surely there was room with all the sweetened bars! I found it in the US under the name Barbara's in the Health Food section! Please bring it back!,249,,,
Carebear,5,I cannot find it to purchase anywhere. Is it still available?,249,,,
Jewel,5,I love Muffets Shredded Wheat Cereal. Just can't believe they were discontinued. Please Please make them again. They don't have all that sugar that most other cereals do. Just plain goodness. From Jewel in Canada.,249,,,
Gus,5,Must have been too costly to produce. Is that right Quaker company?,249,,,
Marlene,5,I’m 79 yrs. old & an insulin dependent Diabetic. This is the best cereal on the market & so sad to hear they are no longer available. Please bring them back for us many Diabetics who were so dependent on them.,249,,,
Drury,5,"I am afraid that Quaker informed me that they are no longer manufacturing the cereal. Very, very sad.",249,,,
RolledWheatRock,5,I'm 60 and I ate Muffets since I sat over the forced air outlet and read the Saturday comics! My mom never let us have the sugary cereals so Muffets were very common. I got some at Real Canadian about 4 months ago but nothing since. Does Quaker just not make them any more? That would be a shame for many.,249,,,
mini_meseeracin,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I am 59 and have been eating Muffets since I was 4 years old. I love them. They have no sugar great for diabetics like me.,249,,,
Grain farmer,5,"Since Muffets disappeared from the stores, I have found a few boxes in small independent general stores in rural Manitoba. I have stockpiled 8 boxes! Shredded Wheat is just not the same. Please bring Muffets back to the big chain grocery stores. PLEASE!",249,,,
George,5,"I used to buy 10 packages at a time and freeze them to eat gradually. Now the last box is gone and haven't seen them in the stores for months: No Frills, Rome's, Food Basics, Metro...???? Help! Bring them back! PLEASE!",249,,,
old-hay-bales,5,Where is the original Muffets - the 'round hay bales' style?,249,,,
v.e.,5,WHY is this cereal no longer available - ANYWHERE!,249,,,
Ash,5,I've been trying to find it for about a year. I love the taste and texture and the fact that it comes without added sugar. I like mini wheats except the sugar ruins them.,249,,,
Irma,0,Can't find them in Sobeys/Safeway. Need to get them in the stores.,249,,,
spooks,5,When will Quaker Muffetts be available again?,249,,,
CaptainLen,5,"My Dad and I used to enjoy breakfasts every morning with a bowl of Muffets. After Dad passed, I continued eating Muffets every day and I still do at age 65 but now I can't find them anymore. This was the best breakfast cereal ever. Please bring it back.",249,,,
hungering,0,"I cannot find Muffets or Shredded Wheat in Amherst, NS for the first time ever... what gives?",249,,,
Blandy,5,"We cant find it anywhere in London Ontario, Canada. The staff say they cant get enough of it! The company say there is no demand for it. Get it on the shelves!",249,,,
SandyVW,5,Ate these as a child... my favorite. My Mom would boil water and pour it on these round morsels and then drain them right away... then pour whole milk on them and top them with sugar. We would add fresh raspberries from our patch when they were in season. They are much more compact than the rectangle ones.,249,,,
Ronny,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Love them, miss them greatly. As a child we would butter them then cinnamon and sugar. Probably the precursor to Mini Wheats but much better. Would love to be able to find them in Florida.",249,,,
Paul A.,5,"My favorite all time cereal, great nutrition, 'toasted perfectly,' stays crisp in milk, delicious. Hard to find now, so I buy a whole case when it is available. Quaker and Barbara's shredded wheat are the same thing I assume.",249,,,
Budge,4,"My husband and I bought Muffets at Sobeys in Sherwood Park, AB yesterday and enjoyed them today with nothing but good old milk added. We may add some blueberries or other fruit tomorrow. Yummy!",249,,,
Davo,4,"After opening package, found that box was at least an inch (2.5cm) short of filled. I consider that a deception and a form of theft! Cardboard and shipping space must be less costly to Quaker than wheat. Quaker may plead settling of product after packaging. Total rot! Wont be buying more, this after 70 years of patronage! - David.",249,,,
cindy,5,Just had a bowl of Muffets with milk and brown sugar... yummy... we live in southern Ontario and purchase these at Giant Tiger... kudos to them for carrying them!,249,,,
Careful Consume,1,"I loved eating Muffets, until I read the following on the side of the box: ""BHT has been added to the waxed paper envelope to help maintain freshness."" Soon as I read that the food was in contact with BHT, I threw the package of the cereal in the garbage.",249,,,
Leesa,5,"Ate these as a kid. Always liked them better than the rectangular SW biscuits and thought they held together better. We buttered these generously, warmed them in the oven, than poured hot milk over. Still follow this recipe with Shredded Wheat rectangular biscuits to this day. Yum. Wish I could buy Muffets. Have to visit Canada I guess.",249,,,
P.M.A.,5,"Terrific shredded wheat cereal, nutritionally and a pleasure to eat - crisper than other shredded wheat cereals and 'roasted' just right!",249,,,
ReetaAnita,5,"I love them, but are they gluten-free?",249,,,
Drury,5,We get them at Your Independent Grocer and Loblaws.,249,,,
Suzy Q,5,We have loved Muffets since childhood but haven't been able to find them in Sobeys or No Frills in Brighton since November. Does anyone know where they are sold?,249,,,
Rosy,4,"I am so happy to find out how to eat these things. I bought them for the ingredients and then had mush in my bowl! So after reading your comments (thank you), I had a lovely breakfast... added blueberries and apple with the milk!",249,,,
stonehenge,5,I also love them. Found them at an independent grocer in Peterborough Ontario Canada. Will still keep looking for them in Whitby as well.,249,,,
Jim F.,5,"Are Muffets shredded wheat still sold in Canada. I have been searching for months. - James Faulds, Pointe Claire (Montreal), Quebec.",249,,,
Scampi G,5,I grew up on Muffets. They are much better then the competition! We would put the hot water on them then squeeze it out and add milk and sugar. 1950's version of a hot breakfast! Wish we could still get them in the US!!,249,,,
C. Macgiver,4,"Toured the plant in Niagara falls, Ontario as a kid. Just bought some Muskets at Sharps. Still great.",249,,,
Yumarama,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Wow, sends me back a few decades. Had these a lot when I was a kid; we'd pour boiling water on a couple in a bowl, let them soften up a bit - not TOO much or they'd get all mushy! - then squeeze the water out by putting another bowl on top. Yes, we were handling boiling water as kids. I can actually ""memory smell"" them right now - how weird! Anyway, add some milk and brown sugar and eat away.",249,,,
bill51,0,"Rather than lamenting on the past, if this cereal means that much to all of you, why not send Pepsico/Quaker a message telling them how much you miss it and want to know when you can expect it to again start the US distribution of your favorite ""Muffets?"" Preaching to the choir will get you nowhere. Contacting the maker with enough mail may have a very positive result for American Muffet eaters. I sent mine! And while were on the subject of cereal... What happened to Kellogg's ""Concentrate Cereal?"" I could eat an entire box in one sitting. Well, perhaps two sittings.",249,,,
chasmears,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Being sold in Canada. I have not been able to find them in the United States or on line. If anyone knows where to get them in Missouri or Kansas or on line, please pass on the information. They show up on Amazon, but not currently available.",249,,,
Jack,5,My mom served me two of them with butter/sugar and warm milk. I still have my shredded wheat that way. I didn't know Muffets still existed?,249,,,
gmaw,5,We still get Muffets at the IGA and love them. The only difference now in them and Shredded Wheat is that they are in paper packages instead of the cardboard that used to separate layers. Still love them though.,249,,,
drury,5,"There was a malted version. I contacted Quaker to see what happened to them, and was informed that they stopped producing them due to weak sales. A real pity. The regular ones are still wonderful!",249,,,
RGS,5,I believe that there was also a malted version in the past. What ever happened to them?,249,,,
LongView,4,"I have had the jingle for the Muffets Shredded Wheat going on in my head for two days... don't know why: Is it long? (No, no!) Is it square? (No, no!) Is it Round? (Yes, yes!) Muffets Shredded Wheat! ... It was kind of Music Man chanted and only a bit of real singing at the end. Strange.",249,,,
wayne n.,0,"I bought a box of these today at my local Independent in North Bay Ont, it was like meeting an old friend. I thought they had quit making these years ago. Sounds like the stocking of Muffets is hit and miss with the grocery stores.",249,,,
KRF,5,"You can buy something similar at Whole Foods in the US. It's an all natural product called Barbara's Shredded Wheat. Same shape, same taste. Introduced my 9 year old daughter to them and she loves them.",249,,,
georgdon,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I notice that this product has left the larger stores and I am unable to but it any longer. Is it still made as it is my favorite breakfast?,249,,,
skittles76,5,This cereal reminds me of when i was a kid and my mom would feed us this in the morning after we went for a walk. It was usually served heated with milk because it was in the winter. It was like a warm hug and tasted so good! I have turned my husband onto them and we love them and eat them sometimes for supper if i don't feel like cooking... ;),249,,,
Jpgirl,4,Found Muffets at Giant Tiger in Manitoba Canada. Eating them for the very first time. Super good! Thank you :),249,,,
Lucky CA,5,I live in Canada and we are eating them this morning. YUM!,249,,,
Connie W.,5,"Muffets was my favorite breakfast food. I would like to know if it is still made? If so where is it available? I used to get it at a flea market here in California until late 1980 - early 90s, or on trips back to the Detroit area. Any information you can supply me would be appreciated.",249,,,
Frury,5,"The cereal is still available in Canada, and I suppose there are some mail-order places in the USA that would order it for people in that country. Would be worth it! I eat it almost every morning.",249,,,
daizie,0,I have eaten Muffets for over 70 years - found them after a long spell of not finding them and now they are gone again. My father used to put milk on them and put it in the oven for a short time. I miss them. June Swint Geneseo Il. daizie@theinter.com,249,,,
ricky,0,I have'nt seen Muffets on the market for many years but they were awesome. Where are they?,249,,,
Jake,0,Do you have any recipes for cookies that contain Muffets? jeanannekirwin@shaw.ca Thanks. -JKK,249,,,
Ageless Kid,0,"This was changed to QUAKER SHREDDED WHEAT in the 1960's. It was round, not square like NABISCO or KELLOGG'S.",249,,,
Carl,5,I am so disappointed that I don't see this cereal on the shelf any more - glad to learn it is still produced in Canada!,249,,,
Drury,5,"I love this cereal, too, and it is still available in Canada. A few years ago, they put out a malted version of it, and it was absolutely delicious.",249,,,
Rusty,5,"One of my favorites. All healthy ingredients. No salt, and no sugar. Hard to beat. - Oshawa, Ontario, Canada.",249,,,
spashman,5,I've eaten Muffets for years and still do. It's my favorite.,249,,,
Johnny,5,"Of all the shredded wheat products, we have always enjoyed the Quaker Muffets most. However, they have not been in our stores for years. We sure would like to know where we can get them. No product currently marketed in our area even comes close. Will appreciate your response. Thanks. Pastor John Weyand, retired Fairfield Glade, Tennessee",249,,,
love it,4,(Team Breakfast Member)  I have eaten Muffet all my life and love it.,249,,,
rbutler53,4,How much Potassium is in Muffets? I need to know as I am being prepared for dialysis. My email is rbutler53 at cogeco.ca.,249,,,
Byron,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) Breakfast has really gotten boring. Every morning I open the fridge and stare at the eggs and ponder? - boiled? - scrambled? - fried? - poached? And i try to get my head around - waffles? - pancakes? - brown toast? - white toast? (My neighbor across the street says he does the same thing some mornings and usually settles for 6 eggs in the blender with a half bottle of Tabasco and goes back to bed and starts his life over a couple of days later) Then I open the pantry and study the row of Quaker oats - original, regular and variety pack that we love and trust, and a variety of cold cereals that have become about as inspiring as a bowl of purple cabbage. Then one morning I was about to close the pantry door and go jog or something when suddenly a voice whispered in my ear (my right ear i think) and said ""Grab that box of Quaker 100% Natural Whole Wheat Muffets, Homer, I got an idea"". I replied, ""My name is not Homer, and you'll have to whisper a little louder, I got this hearing problem -- who is this""? ""Never mind Ho -- uh -- whatever -- go get a cereal bowl and place a muffet precisely in the center --- gently now - gently! -- that's it -- now squeeze a 4 second squirt of honey on the top and let it ooze down into the muffet for a minute"". ""You sure you know what you're doing Voice""? I said. ""Shut up dude and pay attention"". ""Ok, ok! what next""? ""Well I notice you have some fresh blueberries in your fridge and I want you to pick out 14 firm dry ones and encircle the golden brown biscuit with them"" --- ah yes, that's it, good - good. Now grab one of those bananas and mash about a 2 inch length of it and spread it over the honey"". I followed ""it's"" instruction, then mustered up a look of incredible awe and said, ""By golly Voice, that looks good! -- is that it? -- That''s your idea""? A blast of hot, wet, air attacked my inner ear, in the form of an impatient snort, and the voice said, ""Not quite Bubba -- go get some milk and pour it into the bowl until it comes half way up the muffet - then slap it into the microwave for 34 seconds --- no more"". The look of incredible awe slid off my face and i blurted, ""You're kidding! -- and my name is not ---- oh never mind"". There was a pregnant pause then an irritated voice said, ""Just DO it Francis""!! 34 seconds later the voice said, ""You got any of that whipped-cream-in-a-can""? I didn't answer but opened the fridge and brought out a large bottle of catsup and said, ""is red alright""? -- and I braced myself for another super-saturated-snort. Good grief!! Some voices have absolutely no sense of humor. I exchanged the catsup for the whipped-cream and ""it"" ordered me to squirt a fluffy topping on the muffet and drop three blueberries into it. ""Oh and while you are at it"" said the voice,""you might as well crown the whole shebang with one of those strawberries sitting there --- what are you, a fruit freak Freddie""? I stood back and studied it for a moment and said ""Voice, that really does look delicious ---- and pretty as all get out"". ""Well don't just stand there admiring it"" the Voice urged. ""sit down boy, eat up, it's best before the milk soaks it's way to the top of the muffet"". I obeyed -- then with unfeigned enthusiasm exclaimed, ""Oh Voice, this is incredible! - It's wonderful! - it's heavenly! -- and - and --- really tasty. How can I ever thank you? You have brought new life and excitement to all my AM's of the future. I love it. Then with a final muffled whisper, that sounded exhausted, the Voice said, ""Aw, don't mention it --- you did good Homer, you did good"". ""Now how the heck do I get out of your ear? I'm up to my tonsils in wax"".",249,,,
Byron,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) You can't find Muffets in your grocery store? We just bought another box a couple of days ago. We live in Alberta Canada and buy it all the time. In fact, I just emailed a breakfast recipe for Muffets a few days ago. I don't know if it got through. I've never done such a thing before. I think people would love it. Byron bashurtz@telus.net",249,,,
Patty575,5,"I miss this cereal!! Why isn't it in our grocery stores anymore? If I remember correctly, you also had malt flavoured Muffets as well they were particularily tasty.",249,,,
BENSMITH,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I have probably eaten a thousand boxes of muffets in my lifetime but I can't find them anymore. please bring this product back to the store shelves. We have so many sugar coated stuff out there that maybe this would stop some of the obesity going on in our country.,249,,,

xhuntress21x,5,I'm so SAD! I've known this was out for a while - like MANY years but I keep hoping every time I go down the cereal aisle I will see it!

Cereal Pro,5,"This is the OG cereal. Tastes really good. Without Multi-Bran Chex I've fallen into a serious depression. It was crunchy, it was sharp, and it made for a heck of a nutritious breakfast.",250,,,
multibranfan,5,"Wheat Chex at one time was my favorite cereal. Then Multi Bran Chex was introduced and it was even better. Then they STOPPED making it, and tried to pacify us with a bunch of 'new' flavors. General Mills, please wake up and realize that several million of your cereal customers are older than 12, and don't crave junk food for breakfast. My family stopped buying GM cereals when it became clear that Multi Bran Chex was history and we have now cultivated a taste for Best Choice cereals. Saving approximately $200/year on our food budget also feels pretty good.",250,,,
Ashley,5,Please start making Multi Bran Chex mix again. My mom complains every time we are in the cereal isle that they no longer make it. I see other people love it too. Please bring it back.,250,,,
Eddie,5,Really hope they'll consider making this again. They seemed to have replaced this with flavored cereals like strawberry and chocolate that I wouldn't even try. Please bring back the Multi Bran Chex.,250,,,

She misses it also and said it was the one thing that helped her from terrible constipation and she enjoyed eating it.

There's nothing that compares on the market currently.",250,,,

olliesmom,5,"I also liked Multi Bran Chex very much. We hear all the time to increase fiber in our diets, so why would General Mills stop making it. Oh I know... to make more ""flavored"" cereals like banana nut, chocolate, apple cinnamon. Come on Chex bring back multi bran.",250,,,

bwm1010,5,This has been one of my favorite cereals for years. Suddenly I was no longer able to find it on the shelves. Now I know why. Very disappointed that it has been taken off the market.,250,,,
Disappointed,5,"I always ate Multibran, never any of the others. Just a half banana, some Craisins, and skim milk. Nothing else needed! Now they have vanilla, cinnamon, etc, but not your best one... Multibran. Wheat bran does not taste the same. Not buying any more Chex cereals!",250,,,

So Confused,5,"I have tried them all and nothing is as good as Bran Chex. It is a huge disappointment to no longer have a healthy and deserving product back on the shelves. The minute they were on the grocery store shelves, they were gone within a day... is this hard to understand... a cult like following for a product and they no longer make it?",250,,,
B.T.,5,"I agree that this is one of the best tasting fiber cereals. I don't care for Rice, Corn or Wheat Chex either. Please bring this cereal back!",250,,,
Juddy,5,"Evidently, General Mills doesn't care that quite a few of their customers want Multi Bran cereal to come back. They would rather make more sugar cereals. When ever I made Chex mix, I always used Bran, and now it is not the same, I can't add sweet Chexs or chocolate Chexs. Don't they care? What about the older generation who used bran for their health? Why discontinue something that is good and healthy for something not so healthy and probably not so good for you?",250,,,
wholenewyou,5,"If you want this cereal back, you should leave a comment on their FaceBook page - I did :)",250,,,
jori,5,Bran Chex was delicious with raisins added to it. It was so much fresher tasting than premixed raisin bran cereals. BRING IT BACK!! Can we start a campaign?,250,,,
Auntie B,5,This cereal was a new favorite and then it disappeared! Why? I liked it much better than Wheat Chex which I refuse to buy. Please reintroduce this cereal to make many happy consumers?,250,,,

auntieg,5,Always one of my favorite cereals. Please bring back Multi Bran Chex.,250,,,
BringBranBack,5,"I love Multi Bran Chex. Every time I got to grocery store I ask why they don't carry it? They have a better flavor than the other Chex cereals. So now, I don't eat cereal at all and I used to love it in the morning.",250,,,

Brandy,5,Please bring back the Multi Bran Chex! My Chex party mix won't be the same without it. I can't understand that someone thought this was a good idea. It was the only Chex cereal that we would eat for breakfast. It doesn't matter that it was not gluten free!,250,,,
Ekaine,5,"Please bring back Multi Bran Chex. It is the best for party mix, which may just go chex-less this year.",250,,,

GolferGirl,5,"PLEASE, PLEASE bring back Multi-Bran Chex! They can make shelf space by discontinuing some of those horrible overly-sweet Chex. There are plenty of other cereals for kids that are sweet. Give us back our healthy, delicious Multi-Bran Chex!",250,,,
nancy,5,"Please bring it back. My ""Party Mix"" is not going to be very good without it. In fact, I may quit making it altogether - which means I won't be buying Rice Chex, Corn Chex or Wheat Chex either. I only buy those for the mix; multi-bran is the only one I would buy to just eat as morning cereal.",250,,,
g.m.e.,5,I couldn't believe that it was discontinued either. It was definitely popular everywhere I shopped. I can't tell you how often the spot on the shelves was empty. I would often buy several boxes at a time in case it was wiped out on another shopping trip. Was a reason ever given?,250,,,
M.L.,5,Bring back my favorite cereal! Please.,250,,,
D.P.B.,0,"I agree! Bran Chex is the best cereal ever... crispy and healthy. I also can't understand why they continue with those sweet, insipid flavors, and drop the bran, which is much better. I'm depressed about it, and keep searching. All the stores that used to carry it have stopped. PLEASE bring it back.",250,,,
Eggshell,5,"Why discontinue a product that everyone seems to be raving about? Stupid corporate America! It's the only cereal I can eat. And as a blood donor for the past 20 years, Multi Bran Chex provided 90 percent of my daily iron needs! Please bring it back! Not everything needs to be gluten-free; let us decide that for ourselves and stop trying to be politically correct.",250,,,
Angus,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) I used Multibran Chex in my party mix. I miss it. I also I live in northwest. I can't believe with all the different kinds of Chex, they would discontinue the best one!",250,,,
tommy,5,"I (truck driver) used to buy five boxes of Chex Multi Bran in the Harris Teeter stores, every time I passed through North Carolina because I couldn't find it (actually) for sale on line.

MultiBranFan2,0,"No formal notice that this product has been discontinued - not even on their website.

Rich R,5,My absolute favorite breakfast cereal is Multi-Bran Chex. I used to buy a box every other week. Why in heaven's name was it discontinued? It was healthy and satisfying. Please bring it back!,250,,,
N.J.,4,My husband has been eating Multi Bran Chex for years. Why stop making it??,250,,,
Sissy,5,This is really the only cereal I like. I have tried other Chex and bran cereals since I couldn't find Bran Chex and do not like any of them. They are either too sweet or got soggy too fast. PLEASE bring back Bran Chex.,250,,,
P.M.M.,5,"Why on earth did General Mills discontinue the best cereal they made? I used to buy multiple boxes of Chex cereals for my family every time I shopped. As the kids have grown up, they are more interested in healthy alternatives, not candy-flavored breakfast cereals. Such a shame. Now Kashi gets all my business.",250,,,

P.J. Eight,5,"My husband and I LOVE this cereal! I thought my local market just stopped carrying it. I went to other stores to find it, that also used to have it. I just came home and Googled ""Multi Bran Checks"" and I found this site telling me it's been discontinued! Really, why would you get rid of a healthy cereal? very time I purchased it, it wasn't as though we were the only ones buying it. I don't want Vanilla or chocolate flavored cereals - my husband and I are adults for heavens sake. PLEASE BRING IT BACK! Thank you.",250,,,
Ona,5,"In desperation, I tried the Vanilla flavored Chex and found it too sweet and not a good substitute for Bran. I'm through with cereal until I see Bran Chex on the grocery shelf again.",250,,,
Linko,5,Yep! I agree with all the other comments! Please bring it back! My husband makes his own Raisin Bran by mixing plain bran flakes with plain raisins so it is far less sweet than buying ready-made Raisin Bran. It's getting hard to find even plain bran flakes now. Enough with the added sugars and flavors catering to the 5 year old. I like chocolate milk but I don't want a bowl of cereal swimming in it - ick!,250,,,
Edd,4,Why would they discontinue the one good cereal that was good for you?,250,,,
PatD,5,Only cereal in the entire aisle that works for me if you get my drift. What are you all buying instead? Post Raisin Bran is too sweet. Others bloat me. Help!,250,,,
PleaseGeItBack,5,I've eaten Multi-Bran Chex every day for the last 10 years. I think it got cancelled because it was such a well-kept secret.

I am reduced to eating all kinds of cereals which taste like cardboard as I try to find a replacement. Anyone had any luck?,250,,,

tonino613,5,"It is TOTALly - pun intended! - incomprehensible that GM would discontinue a fantastic tasting and HEALTHY cereal such as MultiBran Chex. This was inevitably a 'marketing decision' I'm sure - read: the minority consumer be SCREWED!! Well, I'll vote with my wallet and will ""DISCONTINUE"" buying GM cereals altogether!! POST and Kellogg's healthy cereals will serve me just fine. You lost many good customers with this insane decision, marketing gurus - idiots!",250,,,
Tom B.,5,This has been my favorite cereal for years. Wheat Chex is a poor substitute. Still looking for a replacement (It won't be from General Mills).,250,,,

Eileen in VT,5,Just found out that my local grocery store does not have Multi Bran Chex anymore because it has been DISCONTINUED BY THE MANUFACTURER. My quality of life is now diminished. No more tasty cereal with dried cranberries. Jeezum! Please bring this cereal back. - Eileen in Vermont,250,,,
Multi Bran Mistake,5,OMG... I had no idea Multi Bran has been discontinued! I thought the stores where just giving the shelf space to the new sugary flavors. Which they could have put that crap in the candy isle. Dumb move G.M. you should have discontinued the wheat ones!,250,,,
lapcat4,5,I lived in Chicago and it started disappearing from the shelves two years ago. I found it at Woodman stores. Now I live in St Louis and and was able to get it until very recently.

Nonsense,5,"That Multi-Bran Chex have been discontinued is extremely disappointing. It was the only cereal I ate for years - two or three boxes a week. Wheat Chex are like cardboard, minus the fiber. Perhaps I will switch to oatmeal. These new Chex flavors are ridiculous. I can only conclude that General Mills was not selling enough Multi-Bran Chex and decided to sell crap instead. So much for the legacy of Ralston-Purina.",250,,,
Lakeabuela,5,"This is the best of the Chex cereals. I don't understand why they keep making the Wheat Chex. It's dry and tasteless, whereas the Multi Bran Chex is very tasty and it's good for you. Please bring it back!",250,,,
C.B.,5,I'm so disappointed with General Mills. Discontinuing the Multi Bran Chex product (the best tasting Chex product GM had) has gone down (as far as I'm concerned) as one of THE worst business decisions ever made.

Grandpa_John,5,"This has been my favorite! I'm down to my last box, and I see Amazon is selling more for (gasp) $40 a box! And there are not too many left; ""Buy now!"" they say.

Since finding M.B Chex started becoming very hard I have tasted other bran cereal and nothing comes close to the taste and texture. If General Mills doesn't bring it back soon, another company will find a way to recreate Multi Bran Chex and market it in a way that will keep it around. I will not be buying other Chex. Other disappointed customers try Trader Joe;s Multi-Bran O's until General Mills comes to their senses. Same taste but the texture isn't quite as good... Closest I found :/",250,,,
Cindy Lou,5,Please bring it back. It is the best tasting high fiber cereal out there!,250,,,

cindy,5,My husband & I are both upset as well that they have discontinued Multi-Bran Chex. It is one cereal that has enough natural sweetness that it needs no sugar or other sweetener. The rice & corn Chex are great for Chex mix but the multi bran is the best for eating as cereal. Please bring it back in a bigger box even.,250,,,
MultiBranLove2,5,Why did General Mills discontinue making Multi Bran Chex? All their other Chex flavors just don't cut it - no taste. Please bring Multi Bran Chex back! My whole family loves them. It's been my personal favorite for over a decade now.,250,,,

BoundUp,5,I just found out today that the last store I was able to find it in has quick selling it too. What's up General Mills - it's a popular product and you taken away from the consumers. My doctor recommended it to me for IBS and it has help a whole lot. It is digestible and it makes the bowels run smoothly. I use to buy 5 to 6 boxes at a time. Please put it back on the shelves in stores.,250,,,
JRM OKC,5,"I've eaten Multi-Bran CHEX for over ten years, buying five boxes at a time lasting three weeks. No longer stocked in Oklahoma City. WHY NOT? This is a food item prescribed by my doctors. Anything else on shelf is JUNK and unhealthy. JRM",250,,,
Nori Nik,5,This is the very best cereal on the market for our aging population! Why would they take it off the market. If it is not selling the problem lies with their marketing not their product. I hope they reconsider!,250,,,
trehugr,5,I have been eating this cereal every morning for breakfast for the past five years. Please keep producing it! Otherwise I will have a huge hole in my life.,250,,,
Grich,5,This cereal has no competitors and I really like it. Why are they taking it away?,250,,,
Rachel55,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This is one of our families' favorite cereals. I was upset to find out that I could no longer get it at Bud's Shop n' Save in Newport, Me. We were eating this cereal when it was a Purina brand and still continued to eat this cereal when GM took over the Chex line and added more sugar to it. Please tell me where I can still purchase this cereal. I was upset when the store went out of Quaker corn Bran and now this. What the store offers now is wheat bran and my family doesn't like it. Bran is the most healthy part of the cereal as it has the most nutrients. Please bring this cereal back.",250,,,
TopDawgie,5,"Bring Multi Bran Chex Back please! It was the best of the Chex cereala. It was a good cereal, a good snack and a great ingredient in Chex Mix.",250,,,

Starved,5,Please bring this cereal back. It has been my favorite for many years. I can't get it at any of my area stores.,250,,,

LoveMultiBran,0,"Multi-bran Chex has long been one of our favorites, but I can no longer find it in my area. I did an online product search and discovered that the closest place to find it is located 22 miles away. With the cost of gas today, that would make for a very expensive box of cereal. OK - back to corn flakes!!",250,,,
TGL,5,"I love Multi Bran Chex but I am no longer able to find in any of the local stores. Is it being discontinued in Orlando. My friends in NJ, NY, PA, DE, VA have it in their local stores.",250,,,
best,4,"My stores no longer carry Multi-Bran Chex. I love it and have talked with all the stores about this. Please, General Mills, correct the situation. Perhaps they could mark the boxes with ""No Fructose Corn Syrup"". That might lure the folks back.",250,,,
jjb102764,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  My Dad likes this cereal. Where my parents live they can't find it anymore. I keep looking in my local area for it. If Amazon has it for sale you would think the grocery stores would too.,250,,,
Mo,5,"I love this cereal, but only Amazon seems to have it anymore.",250,,,
WantMyChex,5,I have also been looking for this cereal that is no longer found at my local grocery stores. What's going on? It's one of my favorites and I miss it.,250,,,
gamma,0,We love this cereal... Multi Bran Chex. We can no longer find it at our local chain stores.,250,,,
Georgia O.M.,5,I love this cereal but I can no longer find it at any of my local grocery stores.,250,,,

Booboo,5,Does anyone still have the recipe using this cereal to make muffins? I think it had sour cream as an ingredient. I contacted Kellogg's and they said they deleted the recipe from their files. The muffins made with this cereal are SO good. Please anyone!,686,,,
Mamallama,5,I so miss this cereal and would buy if available!,686,,,
paperlady,5,The very best taste - please bring it back.,686,,,
justins grandma,5,Please bring this cereal back. It was my favorite.,686,,,
Puff Dragon,5,I was so disappointed when they stopped making it. We went thru a box at least every week. Please bring it back.,686,,,
elfmaster38,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Kellogg's... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring this delicious cereal back... should never have been discontinued.,686,,,
frisbee,5,Did anyone else send away for the official Raisins Rice & Rye frisbee? I still have mine!,686,,,
Rellims,5,I've been looking for an alternative that is like RR&R. It was my favorite. I think it was ahead of its time. I hope they bring it back some day soon!,686,,,
reminiscing,5,Would buy it now if it were available again. LOVED it.,686,,,
Gobble_On,5,"RR&R was taken from us too soon, too soon. But at least it died doing something it loved, being eaten by me for breakfast, or sometimes dessert.",686,,,
Cliff G.,5,"I would pay $5,000.00 to have Kellogg's bring back Raisins Rice and Rye cereal!",686,,,
BigSeanMcCereal,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was one of the best cereals ever and should never have been discontinued. Have been searching for one like it ever since, with no success. It had the best texture, yet was chewable unlike so many cereals now that have teeth-ruining balls of ""grain"" as hard as rocks that risk your teeth and dental work. Kellogg's has many cereals now (including Smart Start) that contain these rock-hard pieces that never get soft in milk, so I have to avoid them and never buy them once I discover these nasty bits within. It seemed Kellogg's was possibly trying to duplicate the wonderful firm and hearty texture of RR&R with Smart Start and a couple of other cereals, so I tried them, but was disappointed, had to give them up soon after due to the teeth-ruining bits. I always think back to Raisins Rice & Rye, which was eminently chewable and had no nasty rock-hard pieces, it had only excellent, firm flakes that became perfectly textured with just the right consistency, in milk. Kellogg's should bring it back! It was the best cereal ever for texture and flavor combined. They should duplicate the recipe, formulation, and baking procedures exactly so as not to risk coming up with those idiotic rock-hard bits which show up in so many of their cereals nowadays, rendering them un-buyable. Bring back RR&R, please!!",686,,,
Trainguy,5,"Loved this cereal. Appears I'm not the only one, either. Come on Kellogg's, bring it back out!",686,,,
Ekodle,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  RR&R was far better than Total or any other cereal on the market. Try again and give it another chance. I don't care what COLOR the box is! I was a mom when they introduced this cereal. Now I'm a grandmother. Id like to be notified that it will be available again.,686,,,
billy,5,I agree with all of the comments! It got me through my pregnancy cravings lol. Kellogg's PLEASE bring it back!,686,,,
Pepper P.,5,My all-time favorite forever! It had the rye(t) stuff!,686,,,
LisaMc,5,"I agree with all these comments! This cereal is my all-time favorite as well. Maybe someone could start a petition and Kellogg's would begin producing it again. It was even good dry from the box, without milk. Kaboom is my next all-time favorite. Oh, the memories...",686,,,
SpecK,5,RR&R was and will always be my favorite cereal. Nothing comes close. The Rye did give it a unique flavor and the flakes were more tender than a bran flake. I'm afraid I have turned to drinking rye whiskey to overcome the depression of this cereal walking out on me. Kellogg's? Please. Come back.,686,,,
B. Bish,5,Probably my number one or two cereal of all time. I believe they had changed the color of the packaging toward the end of the time they made it. I figured this was why it finally got dropped... due to people not seeing the dark red box and opting for other cereals. The taste was really good. Better then plain raisin bran. Too bad they do not make this anymore.,686,,,
Big B.,5,"If I'd had any idea that they were going to discontinue it, I'd have bought several cases. There was nothing like it!",686,,,
Disheartening,5,I loved this cereal. Just thought I couldn't find it. This is really disheartening when one of my favorite things is no longer available.,686,,,
Ryan70,5,This was my favorite cereal growing up! I wish I could still get it. :(,686,,,
elwoodblues1969,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I concur... Raisins,Rice & Rye is one of my favorite cereals of all time! I daydream about it, I dream about it, I fantasize about it coming back to the market! Obviously, going by the several positive comments here, this cereal is in high demand after all of these years and Kellogg's doesn't give a hoot... Thanks Kellogg's!",686,,,
ChrisfromIowa,5,"Loved RR&R... I mean I'm looking it up online this many years later. I like Raisin Nut Bran and a couple of others, but the rye in the flakes had a really unique flavor. I wonder if you could reproduce these. Any ideas out there?",686,,,
dstromberg,5,"I miss Raisins, Rice and Rye!",686,,,
Gollek,4,"I loved this cereal - too bad it was cut. BTW - ""Dr. Bombay"" is played by the character actor Bernard Fox who also played Colonel Crittendon on Hogan's Heroes.",686,,,
OldGuy,5,I'd definitely buy it if it was available again.,686,,,
QueenAnne,5,This cereal was so good that some days I also ate it for dinner. I wish Kellogg's would bring it back. I also would buy a case.,686,,,
LisaMcMc,5,"I ate this cereal in the 80s as well, when I was in my twenties. Then, suddenly, it disappeared. I've tried to find it on various websites that carry discontinued or limited products with no luck. Kellogg's should definitely bring it back. I would buy a case as well!",686,,,
Hoss62,5,"Sorry, raisin lovers - after Raisins Rice and Rye, the others just can't compete. There are too many sugared cereals and so-called health cereals (all with nuts) but nothing as good as this was. I have been hoping for a revival for years and would also line up for case lots, Kellogg's. Sign me. 62 but not crazy yet...",686,,,
Old.Timer,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Obviously, this was a really good cereal if I can remember the name of it after all these years. I frequently search online trying to find it or something similar, but there is nothing. PLEASE bring it back and make a bunch - I will buy it by the case and probably eat it breakfast, lunch and dinner for awhile.",686,,,
Todd,5,"This cereal was awesome! This is one that could be brought back, if even for a limited time, rather easily. Why don't companies bring back the old cereals for a limited time? They would be huge and really stand out in a world of boring cereals. Do it!",686,,,
yodelfan,0,Where can I get this cereal? I really sounds like something I'd like a lot. I'd never heard of Raisins Rice And Rye before now. Not seeing it for sale online anywhere. Advice?,686,,,
Junior,5,"This cereal was one of the best I've eaten. Then, I went to the grocery store for another box one day and it had vanished off the supper market shelves. What happened? I agree, with most, that Kellogg's should bring it back. It was healthy and delicious.",686,,,
ChgoTO,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  If you ever got to try Raisins Rice & Rye, you would know that it was the BEST CEREAL EVER! Bring it back!",686,,,
thegreat1,5,"Excellent cereal... but I remember thinking that this cereal was discontinued (in the mid-1980's) then noticed that Kellogg's switched to a yellow box vs. the dark red box. So my assumption was that some overly ""smart"" Marketing guy thought the color was too much like other cereals... switched the color and sales dropped. Kellogg's probably thought ""gee this guy was really smart... so the cereal must suck...""",686,,,
Digest_It,5,"I ate Raisins, Rice and Rye in the 1980s regularly and really enjoyed it. I believe the reason I liked it was that this cereal digested easily. I know this now to be true since taking a blood test that determined I have low grade wheat, corn and oat allergies. Most cereals contain wheat, corn and/or oats. Really the only cereals by in large that contain an alternative is Rice Chex and Rice Krispies. Raisins, Rice and Rye would be perfect for my condition since I have no allergic reaction to all three main ingredients. It is believed many people are developing gluten allergies these days because of the over-saturation of wheat, corn and oats in many foods.",686,,,
bored@work,0,"I'm definitely of the ""Raisin Persuasion"" but I don't get the Rye. I never got to try this cereal, but I love Raisins in cereal. My favorite is Raisin Nut Crunch. All I can think of when I hear ""rye"" is rye bread, but I can't imagine that's what it tasted like. What did the flakes taste like?",686,,,
SureMissIt,5,"With the others that said, ""Loved it, bring it back!"" Seems like all the good ones go.",686,,,
berries,5,I was in HS and would eat it every day! I've always missed it so much!,686,,,
doozie,5,"I loved this. I wish I could buy it or make it myself. If anybody has a recipe that might be similar to this cereal, you should post it here.",686,,,
matscosha2,5,Best cereal ever. Loved it and I am very picky. Definitely sad when it was discontinued and hope that one day it makes a comeback.,686,,,

Alex,5,Special K Red Berries (current fave) reminds me of RR&R (my fave back in the day).,686,,,

Mang,5,I LOVED it! Request it at Vermont Country Store (vermontcountrystore.com).,686,,,
undrye,0,"Re: Comment by Chuck... They aren't all Irish. The guy for Rye distinctively said ""und"" ... kind of a mitteleurope guy.",686,,,
Chuck,0,"Anyone remember the commercial? 3 men who spoke in rhyme w/a heavy Irish brogue prepared to board a ship, only to be distracted by the cereal, and finally decide to let it go on w/o them so they can enjoy their breakfast (""And will we wave our good ship bye bye bye? BYE BYE BYE!"").",686,,,

That Guy McFly,5,Gawd I REMEMBER this! :-) And KaBoom!,317,,,
GalaxyCat,5,"This was my favorite cereal as a kid. Every time my mom took us to the market for shopping, I'd go and get my cereal. One day we went for groceries and it was gone. My mom said, sorry I guess they don't have it anymore. So I had to find another cereal to grow up with. I don't know why they pulled it but even as of now as an adult, I'm a little frustrated on why they pulled it when other cereals that started are still being sold today. General Mills should bring it back. Cereal is like a mixture of Kix, Coco Puffs and their own concoction of cereal bits.",317,,,

The Ritty,5,"I COMPLETELY forgot about this cereal until just now. I voted for this one. It was AMAZING. As a Canadian back in the 80's and early 90's, people loved going across the border to the states to shop etc... before the US became 'hated'. I always brought this cereal on the trips we would take to the US. We had nothing compared to the states' cereal until free trade. Like you'd see all these commercials for cereals and we never get them. It sucked. Then TV specials and movies, videos etc, etc... some cartoons didn't come on... but anyways, this one was the bomb.",317,,,
Dawnitablue,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I looked forward to when my parents would splurge on this cereal for us. I wish they would bring it back!,317,,,

RockyRoadFan,5,"Funny story about this cereal... I remember being in 5th grade and my teacher asked me what I ate for breakfast because I was seeming more alert (or maybe just more hyper from the sugar buzz) so I told her 'Rocky Road Cereal' and the whole class started laughing. Not sure why it was that funny, maybe the other kids were eating boring cereal but I was proud of my Rocky Road and that it woke me up in the mornings. My sweet tooth isn't the same now so I probably wouldn't buy it now, but it was great fun back then.",317,,,

Bucksky11,5,It was more like a dessert than a breakfast but it was delicious. This stuff was seriously sugar-coma inducing!,317,,,
Cookie Bear,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  It was the chocolate and nut coated marshmallows that made it special. The rest was just a mixture of Kix and Cocoa Puffs.,317,,,
smackdad1979,5,This gets my vote for the best cereal ever.,317,,,
Carli Romano,5,Bring this cereal back!,317,,,
RandiHook,5,"Bring it back now! Smorz cereal is kind of like it, but nowhere as good.",317,,,
rockyroad,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Why do they always discontinue the good stuff! They must not like making money. I would eat the whole box myself when I was a kid and would again even though I can no longer drink milk. 5 stars from me and then some! P.S. VP of sales and marketing... don't be scared. There's a good market out there for people with the munchies. Gotta take a risk!,317,,,
J-Bear,5,I have very fond memories eating this cereal as a kid. Wish they still made Rocky Road so I could try it again.,317,,,
skydivedoc,5,"I bought some Rocky Road ice cream today and all I could think of is this cereal. Please, oh puh-LEEZE bring it back!",317,,,
Jrod,5,This was a cereal that will always be remembered forever. I loved it back in the 80's and wish my kids can experience it also. Miss it.,317,,,
drgnopt,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I remember this cereal from being a kid, I'm now in my mid 30's and still remember it because it was that incredible! Please bring it back!",317,,,
mygirls,5,"My oldest son lived on Rocky Road, and my daughters never had the opportunity to taste it... Really should bring it back, even for a little while, just so other kids can try it... it amazes me that all the popular kids cereals just disappear from the market... bring Rocky Road back!",317,,,
Kevin L.,5,"With the huge popularity of Reese's Puffs cereal these days, I can't believe Rocky Road isn't around to be a fierce competitor. +1 vote to bring it back!",317,,,
Tan3@yahoo.com,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) Please bring back Rocky Road cereal. It's the best. My daughter would eat almost a whole box when she was small. I tasted it and fell in love with it, too. Get it back...",317,,,
Tink70,5,I was just telling my kids about this cereal the other day. If there is one thing I could have from the good old days it would be this. By all means bring this cereal back. Rocky Road is the BEST!,317,,,
rowdy,5,Man! I used to fall in love with that cereal as a kid. One of my favorite cereals of all time.,317,,,
omega-man,5,I have a fully sealed box of this cereal - please contact me at the-omega-man on Ebay should anyone wish to buy it!!!,317,,,
D.A.X.,5,Oh wow... I LOVED this cereal when I was a kid. Would love for my kids to get to taste it!!,317,,,
suga N.Y,5,Please General Mills - please bring back this cereal so that my kids can taste one of the best cereals of all times... how can we petition to get this cereal on the market even if its for a limited time only. We need to bring rocky roads back from the graveyards of cereals.,317,,,
kingdomwarrior1,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was an excellent cereal!!! I wish this cereal will come back. I used to eat 4-5 boxes a month, but I didn't put on the pounds. LOL!!!",317,,,
Schoms,5,"No other cereal comes even close to Rocky Road. What other cereal can claim that, when the box was nearly empty and there was nothing but crumbs and half-pieces left, did one get excited to tip the box and empty those chocolate crumb pieces into their mouth. It was a fight for the cereal all the way to the bottom of the box! Ah, the memories...",317,,,
ajkiii,5,The greatest cereal of all time!!! But good things never last just like Kaboom & Crazy cow.,317,,,
the-omega-man,5,Easily the best tasting cereal ever.,317,,,
Badgeroo,5,Best cereal ever!!! The amount my brother & I alone ate should have been sufficient to keep profits strong enough to keep it on the shelves forever!,317,,,
luvmarshmallows,5,I loved this cereal. Especially the marshmallows!,317,,,
jerel,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I wish we could still buy this as well... my all time favorite!,317,,,
CactusHeart,5,"I love love LOVE this cereal! I still remember it (and miss it) just as much now as I did back then. I remember how sad I was when it could no longer be found! I remember contemplating stealing the neighbor kid's box in an attempt to collect all of the glow in the dark stickers pictured on the back of the box *lol* Count Chocula is the closest thing to Rocky Road cereal, but it's not quite the same....and count chocula is my favorite cereal of all time, if THAT says anything to you *LOL*",317,,,
Keno,5,I loved this as a kid. My mom would also put it in little bags and pack it in my school lunch. Count Chocula has nothing on Rocky Road! They need to bring it back!!!,317,,,
keight,5,"My favorite as a kid. Still looking for something like it, and disappointed that I haven't found it. :/ Bring it back!",317,,,

NY 70s Kid,2,"My recollection of it from the 1970s was that compared to Post, Kellogg's and supermarket brands, Skinner's was pretty tough sledding. Man, that stuff hurt to chew. And I had strong teeth. Still do, in my 50s. Wouldn't go near it again. I do remember the metal spout on the box, which was the main cool thing about it. I thought there was some connection to the behaviorist scientist BF Skinner but apparently not?",884,,,
coloradofalls,5,"I love Skinners! I didn't appreciate it until I was in college and then my precious mom would send me Skinner's in my care package. It is both a fond memory of my mom, and a much missed anytime cereal from my table. I wish it was available in Houston!",884,,,
Ajord,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I grew up on Skinner's Raisin Bran in the early 1960s. The cardboard box was wrapped in a paper cover that had the pictures and label on it, and to pour the cereal, there was a metal spout on the side that you would pull out. I had not seen the cereal in years, and then about six years ago, Grocery Outlet in Idaho and Eastern Oregon got a huge batch that they sold at a huge discount. I bought quite a lot, and it tasted just the same as I remembered. The wheat flakes had a sort of malt taste, and of course the raisins were a bit hard rather than plump, but the cereal was fantastic and it brought back memories of people long gone. Now if only someone would make Wheat Honeys and Rice Honeys again.",884,,,
RUFUS,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Skinner's was my go to breakfast in the early 40 and 50s. Whether we were going to school, the hay fields, or sheep shearings. I could have just about anything I wanted, but my favorite was Skinner's Raisin Bran with sugar, fresh cream and milk, coffee milk, and a hot cathead biscuit with homemade butter and syrup. Real fond memories.",884,,,
catlady,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I am 51 years old and have never forgotten this cereal. I even remember the character and commercial I made up for it when I was a child, and am planning to make a video of that for my YouTube channel. That's why I looked it up! I love Skinner's Raisin Bran!",884,,,
Me83yrs,5,"I am 83 years old, Skinner's was my dad and my favorite cereal. Now it seems to be discontinued? Bummer!",884,,,
Jake,5,Please advise as to what national stores carries Skinner's.,884,,,
Charlie 86,0,"I'm 86 years old and I have been eating Skinner's Raisin Bran virtually all of my life, when I could find it. I remember prizes in the box, and especially little cards, like baseball cards, which I collected for years. I can't remember what they pertained to. Who does? My grocer has just stopped carrying this item, probably because the ridiculously high price discouraged customers. But I see it's available on line.",884,,,
JohnnyCake,4,Does anybody else remember the prizes? Skinner's had better prizes than Cracker Jack. I think I still have a little compass that came in one box (probably 50 years ago). I think that was the reason for the Boys' and Girls' versions mentioned by another commentator: The prizes were gender-specific. A joy of childhood was the treasure that came in a Skinner's box.,884,,,
220 VOLT,4,"You can order it online from Wal-mart, Amazon and several other online stores.",884,,,
Ole Lady,5,"I was born in the early 1940's and ate Skinner's Raisin Bran always. It used to be the only brand on the shelf. The more popular brands do not have the same taste to the bran flake as Skinner's. I always wondered why Skinner's doesn't advertise this product as being more nutritious, etc. because people today are willing to pay more money for something more healthy. But how will they know if it's not advertised in the store, TV, or anywhere. There was one store around that carried the Uncle Sam's w/ Skinner's written on bottom of box. Now several stores carry Uncle Sam's Flax cereal but not the Skinner's Raisin Bran. Please advertise it so there will be a demand and more stores will begin carrying it. It's the ONLY one I will eat and I really miss it! Thanks.",884,,,
loyaltubist,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  The first time I saw this cereal (summer 1965), I was seven years old on vacation to see family in Oklahoma and Missouri and Skinner's Raisin Bran was everywhere. I remember they had a Boy version and a Girl version. Since the distant cousin I was visiting was a girl, I (a boy), had to eat the Girl version. It's a little less refined than Post, Kellogg's, or the store brand I ate back home in Southern California. I like raisin bran and this is my favorite. And it has lots of fiber! (And it looks like they are rebranding this as 'Uncle Sam's' Raisin Bran. Too bad. Don't those guys at Attune Foots/Post Holdings know how important Mr. Skinner was to raisin bran history? (Very sad.)",884,,,
Skinner Lover,5,"I'm 68 years old. I love Skinner Raisin Bran! My Dad is 90 and I have sisters ages 57, 61, 64, and 70. We talk about this cereal quite often, and the fact that you never see it anymore... We loved it. One of my sisters actually was able to find it online and bought all of us some. NOT UNCLE SAM brand.

Lynn,5,I love it but can't find it anymore.,305,,,
Christina,4,Great but needs more raisins XDDDD,305,,,
Raisins?,3,"I have been faithful for years, as the price goes up, and some stores don't even have Raisin Nut Bran, so I have asked the to order it. But... I get so disappointed every time I eat a bowl, I dig and dig for those delicious raisin nuts, and there just aren't enough. I'm sure I've even thrown some raisin nuts away over the years, as I gave up digging through the flakes, growing soggy... searching, searching... why do I keep doing it? Anyone else tired of getting ripped off?",305,,,
aqua gal,5,"I eat this cereal every morning, it is the BEST !!! wish they would sell the nut covered raisins too...",305,,,
J. Jay,3,The cover lies about the number of nuts. And the flakes are kind of stale.,305,,,

Toxic,4,"The commercials were always so fun! As a kid, eating this cereal was the best part of my mornings. Though it's not exactly Top Tier for me tho (but def prefer it over the candies ngl). However I do remember that website that allows you to make your own raps, design your character and also let's you listen to others' creations. Very good cereal.",309,,,

G. David,5,Very tasty cereal! One of my all-time favorites!,309,,,

c.j.r.,0,"I have been purchasing Reeses Puffs for my son for a while now. He loves them I buy 3 boxes every 2 weeks. I have a complaint. We had opened a box and the wax paper was torn and the cereal was stale. Now this is not cheap cereal, and I would not normally make a big deal out of it, but I am upset and he was, when I threw the box out. So I am contacting you to let you know that this is unfair. I would hate to buy this product and have that happen again. Just letting you know, I am displeased at quality control to allow this box out in the public. Thank you. Christopher J.

Mingmei,5,My childhood favorite cereal. It did have a unique taste. Fruity Pebbles as a replacement? Bleccch.,314,,,
Silvar1955,1,I wrote to Post recently... same thing... no intentions of bringing it back. Rice Krinkles had a unique flavor they were great. But I wonder if they used something that is not allowed to be used today to sweeten it? They could bring it back as Krinkle Pebbles.,314,,,
HAWKEYE2,0,Box was too small (10 oz.). Had to eat as soon as mom brought it home from the store or brothers and sisters would eat it first.,314,,,
zana,5,They were better than GREAT!,314,,,

Jim Jr.,5,Rice krinkles were the best cereal on the market. I would buy the store because it was 300 miles from home.,314,,,
Yajums,5,"What kind of selective 'Political Correctness' is 'Kung Fu Panda'? That's 'approved' today, SO, bring back So-Hi, Rice Krinkles, AND Funny Face Chinese Cherry drink mix. It all means the great taste of a wonderful summer from long ago to me!",314,,,

Jeanne,5,I've emailed this company about bringing back my all time favorite cereal but without luck. I'm going to try asking another company like Vermont Country Store. There is no cereal like it.

Another thing about it was that it was actually dense (heavier) than other cereals. And I agree... it had a perfect, clear crunchy coating that tasted almost carmelized! :-)",314,,,

puffa,5,These were the best! Wish my kids could have had them.,314,,,
Will,5,Rice Krinkles was so much better than Rice Krispies. You couldn't even make the sugar stick on rice krispies. When you put it on and then the milk it dissolved or went to bottom of bowl. Its a wonder Kellogg's didn't try to copy it after post put it to rest :(,314,,,

Palatzo,5,I agree. P-l-e-a-s-e bring it back. I lost weight eating this cereal and reduced my A1C. It cured my yearning for chocolate and made me look forward to morning. (I'm not a morning person.) PS Ditch the Special K. It's awful.,1500,,,

Texas Chocolate,3,Doesn't taste like real Rocky Mountain chocolate.,1500,,,
Joe31,3,"Not getting why everyone is gushing over it. It's OK. Very sweet. They don't use real chocolate but instead ""compound chocolate"" which means it has vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter.",1500,,,

Choking Hazard,4,"Tasted great, however I seemed to get choked up on several bites. Maybe it was just me?",1500,,,
gvrizzi1,0,(Team Breakfast Member) This was so good. I loved it for breakfast and think it is so good that you could make the flakes larger and rebox it as a trail mix in the snack isle! I would eat this before potato chips any day!,1500,,,

aw,0,I could be imagining this but if I remember right the Ruskets flakes commercial had a line-up of circus animals in it.,1205,,,
Jack I,5,Rusket breakfast bars (compressed flakes) were my favorite as a kid of the 50s. It was simple cereal without a bunch of sugar and other junk. You could actually taste the cereal. Whoever bought out the Loma Linda company please bring that cereal back. I no longer live in southern Calif. like I did when I was a kid and most people outside of Calif don't seem to be familiar with Ruskets.,1205,,,
P. Finn,0,Where can I buy Ruskets? Is it possible?,1205,,,
MikeandCarol,5,Ruskets would blow the fenders off of any cereal out there today if the company would bring them back! No contest!,1205,,,
T. Goode,5,One of the memorable cereals from my youth. LOMA LINDA also made a hot cereal in the 1950's which I am unable to find now. It is my all time favorite. Can anyone help?,1205,,,
DJFitz,5,I remember them well. They were the best. What I wouldn't do for a bowl of the Ruskets bricks. Is there anyplace to still buy this delicious cereal?,1205,,,
RusketsFan-3,5,"Please bring them back. I have to eat Weatabix. They are OK, but not as good as Ruskets Flakes.",1205,,,
Thomas P,5,PLEASE bring this amazing cereal back!!!,1205,,,
Trixter808,5,Please bring the biscuit ones back. It was the best cereal ever.,1205,,,
loyaltubist,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  If you notice the pictures here, not only Ruskets Flakes but so are Ruskets. They were made by the Loma Linda Food Company in Riverside, California. (Loma Linda was a town that was almost entirely Seventh Day Adventist, home of Loma Linda University, near San Bernardino which is now a city that still has a large SDA population.) The Loma Linda Food Company was more famous for such products as VegeBurger and Linketts (vegetarian hot dogs). A few decades ago the company was sold to Worthington Foods and the Riverside factory closed down. Worthington is now owned by Kellogg's so Kellogg's could reintroduce Ruskets and Ruskets Flakes. They were everything Weetabix want to be but never were.",1205,,,
Great Grandma66,5,"I remember the Ruskets Bricks. For some reason for the past week or so, I have been remembering how good the cereals of the 50''s and 60''s were. No additives, preservatives, vitamin fortified, and as close to natural as possible. Ruskets Bricks was one of my favorite non-sugared cereals. Now that I have great-grandchildren, I do wish that cereal experts would bring back some of the favorites. As they were, the originals.",1205,,,
Fenwick,5,"I would get to eat the Ruskets compressed-brick cereal when ever I slept over at my friend's house. I LOVED Ruskets! This was back in the early 60s, around 1963 or 64. I would add raisins and, extra sugar :) when his mom wasn't looking. I don't remember the commercial probably because we didn't watch much TV. No rules against it, TV was just boring, we would rather be out riding our bikes.",1205,,,
Greg11,4,"I remember that animated commercial from a local kids cartoon show. A tiger ends it by saying ""And remember kids, there's a prize in every package!""",1205,,,
L.Wlli,5,"I have thought about this cereal many times over the years, and so want them back! Wow... it's great to finally read some of these comments of you that also loved the little awesome breakfast biscuits. Yes, why can't they just make these again? They have brought back a lot of other favs from ""the day"". Hopefully maybe sometime. I distinctly remember the flavor. Nothing they have that resembles it stacks up to the original.",1205,,,
Austin C.,5,I loved Rusket Flakes. It would be great if they came back.,1205,,,
Ron11,5,I sure wish they would bring Ruskets back to the U.S. Wheetabits is similar but not the same.,1205,,,
B.O.B.,5,"I really enjoyed Ruskets - best cereal ever. Post Grape Nut Flakes is close, but just not there.",1205,,,
Lauren4,5,These were the best of the cereals. My kids and I loved them.,1205,,,
grandma241,5,I read some where that Kellogg's bought them out but I could not find anything much except Ruskets were made by Loma Linda Foods. My 9 kids all loved Ruskets and so did my husband. Me Too! So why did they quit making them when everyone loved them and has such fond memories of them. My 59 year old son started this conversation with me this afternoon so I started searching on the internet for an answer. I really did not find one. Lets petition Kellogg's to make them with the exact recipe as original. No MSG & no high fructose corn syrup!,1205,,,

chris,0,Always loved it!,1205,,,
Sharon,5,"Ruskets was one of my favorite cereals growing up in the 60s. I vaguely remember a TV commercial for Ruskets, with a cartoon circus parade. Looked for it online but couldn't find any reference to it. It was a lot of fun to watch. Does anyone else remember it?",1205,,,
Howgar,5,"I grew up near Sacramento in the 50s and 60s and had Ruskets biscuits almost every morning. Too bad it's off the shelves now, probably all the shelf space in markets was bought by ADM or some other agribusiness conglomerate.",1205,,,
DrVideo2,5,I grew up the seventies. I loved the texture of Ruskets cereal. The prizes were nice too.,1205,,,

cd733,5,I remember these from the 60's. They were advertised on Cap'n Delta in Sacramento. They were in biscuits I think. As I remember they were damn good.,1205,,,
ChuckH,0,"This was interesting, when I was a child I wouldn't eat anything but Rusket Flakes. When I got older, they tasted like cardboard to me. Was it my taste had changed or the prizes didn't matter anymore?",1205,,,
DAT,5,"We loved Ruskets cereal in the 50's-60's. Outrageous with strawberries-the malt taste was great. I too would love to have them back. I thought Weetabix was a new version, but the malt flavor is less pronounced and they are less sweet. :-(",1205,,,
Remember This?,0,"Rusket's had a TV commercial circa 1964 with a little girl yelling at the camera: ""Rusket's are good for you, eat Rusket's & Rusket flakes! And there's a prize in every package!""",1205,,,

RLW,5,"rlwagner5169@yahoo.com I have missed being able to find and eat Ruskets cereal. Anymore cereals have turned into garbage food. Ruskets was my favorite breakfast cereal for many years, BRING IT BACK !!!!!!!!",1205,,,

Steve,5,Whatever happened to this great cereal? Maybe it wasn't as great as I remember from 50+ years ago. I'd like to taste it again tho'.,1205,,,
PapaLarry,4,"We preferred Ruskets (biscuits) to any other cereal when I was growing up (50s and 60s). They were a little more money than most though, so we didn't get them nearly as often as we would have liked.",1205,,,

Boog,5,My favorite of all time!,367,,,
K.B.,5,My favorite of all time. I was in my twenties and bought it every time I went to the grocery store. Wish they would bring it back!,367,,,
S.W. Love,5,Kellogg's could have a huge throw back hit bringing this cereal back to the market. Test it out and prove those of us who love it wrong. It's a win/win for you. Huge success or get us off your back. We dare you... :-),367,,,

buddha0302,5,I loved this cereal so much. It was my favorite as a kid I never could understand why they would quit making such a great product.,367,,,
Gibberson,5,"I loved this cereal. It tasted SO good. I wrote Kellogg's back in the 80s to lament the passing of it and they wrote back saying that it wasn't popular enough to continue making it. I thought that they should have just advertised more. What an incredibly great-tasting cereal. I'd have two or three bowls, not just one.",367,,,
clark_kent,5,What would it have to take or cost to bring this product back to the consumer? I would be willing to say I would pay a buck more than Mini Wheats and I would make sure word would get out about how great it is. I feel as an adult now it should be highly recognized since my childhood voice wasn't heard. My parents bought it every chance and I too ate it by the box load at times just because I couldn't get enough.,367,,,
Kate,5,I miss this cereal so much. It was the first box of cereal I bought on my own as a kid (why do I remember this??). Would love to see it in stores again!,367,,,
Sad-its-gone,5,"This was an amazing cereal. Wish it would come back or just add a graham Mini-Wheats flavor and I would be happy. I don't remember ever seeing a television commercial or any other ad for this, so maybe extremely poor marketing was its downfall. It certainly wasn't its taste. Anyone I have ever talked to about it, has always said how much they loved it and why did it go away. Let's hope that Kellogg's gets its act together and does something to bring it back or something similar.",367,,,

catgirl,5,"I don't remember how it tasted, but I do remember being so obsessed with this cereal that my mom went to the local grocery outlet store for what must have been YEARS (did I mention it was also 45 miles away?) to pick up box after box after box. I shudder to think of how expired it must have been by the time they ran out. Anyone think that the new Frosted Mini Wheats Crunch might be awfully similar?",367,,,
Benny59,5,Kellogg's Mini-Wheats whould try a graham flavor and it'd probably taste similar to how I remember SW Graham tasting. It was a really good cereal.,367,,,
J.R.M.,5,S.W. Graham was the best cereal ever. We ate it by the boxful. My good friend from high school and I STILL talk about how it good it was. Bring it back!,367,,,

SWSeeker,5,I have been craving this cereal since I last had it in 7th grade. I look for it every time I go to the grocery store just in case someone found a lost pallet of it in the back. I concur with the other comments and would love seeing Kellogg's bring it back to life.,367,,,
Mosier,5,"I really liked the cereal. S.W. Graham was a preacher. He also worked with grain. He developed the meal that has since been called Graham meal, thus came the Graham cracker. His first name was Sylvester; I do not know what the W. initial stood for.",367,,,
d.j.,5,This was the best cereal I ever had. Please bring it back.,367,,,
Marie,0,I must correct you here... SW Graham was actually released in 1989 NOT 1992 (it was pretty much gone by then). There's a couple commercials on YouTube that prove it.,367,,,
wpkizer,5,I loved this cereal and have never been able to figure out why it was discontinued. Maybe someone with half a brain at Kellogg's would realize what a popular cereal this could be and put it back on the grocery shelve so I can put it back in my cereal bowl.,367,,,
Ben,5,"This is hands down the best cereal I have ever eaten. I remember being stopped in the mall by some market researchers. They showed us the commercial and we got to take a box home to eat. The box was gone in 1 day. I was so excited when I saw it on the shelves for the first time. Sadly, it didn't last and cereal has never been the same since.",367,,,

BrotherGraham,0,"S.W. Graham is the only cereal that I could stand to eat. Stopped eating cereal in my teens but started eating S.W. Graham when I was 40 years old. Fantastic flavor.

MLC,0,"Kroger is making a knock-off brand of shredded wheat that tastes like the old Nabisco product.

Yumarama,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  A staple cereal that I associate with my grandmother. Pour boiling water over a biscuit (or two) in a bowl, let it sit a minute, then press the water out with another bowl. Add a sprinkling of brown sugar and milk; easy hot cereal and quite tasty. I haven't tried the new Post version of this cereal; I am reluctant to do so and find out they have mucked it up.

Maybe it's been a long time since the last time I ate the General Mills version, but in my personal perspective, both have the same flavor. Try it and gimme your opinion.",332,,,

CerealClassic75,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Cereal companies just don't get it... you write to them telling how much a cereal is loved by the masses and they don't care... saying demand isn't there.

If you truly want something back... just write to the company every week til they make it again... and the same way... not some new way.,332,,,
breicfast,5,S'mores Grahams will forever and always be the best cereal.,332,,,
I Want Some,5,The best cereal around. I remember buying at least 3 boxes at a time and having to go back the 4th day because I would be out! I wish they would bring it back. I wrote to GM once but they told me that they make too much others and it's not in demand:(,332,,,

EricTampa,4,Does anyone know where the Smorz are? I can only find them online and the average price is around $6.00 per BOX. It is not on the Kellogg's discontinued cereal list. But it seems like it vanished from the face of the Earth. Any help would be appreciated.,333,,,
Syn,3,"I started eating this when my craving for the S'more Crunch and S'more Graham cereal was very strong. It's not bad, in fact it's pretty good but my desire for those old S'more cereals keeps me from calling it awesome. The grahams are a bit puffier than I would like and the marshmallows tend to get soggy at times, I assume it's to simulate the melted marshmallows of them when made but it just fells gooey.",333,,,

Mr. Plow,5,This cereal rules!,333,,,
Estin,5,"Really? (to reviews below) This is one of my favorite cereals of all time. I buy it at the store even when I don't need it, just to encourage sales so that Kellogg's will continue to make it. I absolutely love this cereal, and I am a considerable cereal consumer (Cap'n Crunch and Frosted Flakes being some of my other top choices).",333,,,
CactusHeart,1,"Yeesh!!! DON'T eat this cereal, read the description on the cereal box instead... Or watch the commercial. You'll get MUCH MORE ENJOYMENT OUT OF THAT than actually EATING THIS CEREAL. Believe it!!! It IS visually appealing, I'll give it that. But as far as TASTE??? This cereal should REALLY be called ""SNORZ""!!! *LOL* This cereal is a pale shadow of it's 80's predecessor: S'mores Crunch or S'more Grahams. What an injustice...how a cereal as fantastic as S'mores Crunch is off the shelf and all we're left with is Kellogg's ""SNORZ""",333,,,
CerealKiller,2,Yuck. All I tasted was marshmallows. Very bland sugar junk cereal.,333,,,

Karen,5,I have been trying to find a berry cereal that matched the flavor of this one and have been unsuccessful. I am in my 40's now and still hop online every now and then to see if I can find anything about them bringing it back. This is my all time favorite... and I love a lot of cereals.,334,,,
FerNifJen,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I miss it. I've been looking for it since I was 6 years old. I wish Post would make it in a retro box... don't change the flavor. Guaranteed every 80s baby would buy a ton.,334,,,
Warlocke,1,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal had a strong chemical taste to it from all the dye. Not an aftertaste; the flavor, from start to finish, was food dye. Just awful.",334,,,
Ryan8900,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Woke up at 3 am craving this cereal... please bring it back!,334,,,
Washington 11,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I remember eating this cereal every morning as a kid at age 2. It brings back so many memories as a child. The cereal was wonderful. Will this cereal ever return to stores? This was better than Trix.,334,,,
Mllyon,5,Awesome Cereal. I really wish they would bring it back. Make sure it taste exactly like it did back then.,334,,,
Yum E.,5,"Yes, I agree with others here. Please bring Smurf Berrys back!",334,,,
Rev-Saint,5,This was one of my favorites growing up.,334,,,
RichK,4,It turned my poop blue. I think that is why I loved it so much!,334,,,
Francis Silla,5,Please bring this cereal back out... this brings back so many memories... I loved the Smurfs in the 80's and I still love them now. I would love to scoop a spoonful of Smurf Berries in the mornings. I'm sure that would help anyone have a Smurfy day! Plus a new movie coming soon. Post could make a lot of money from the older and new generations. I would buy a box just to keep as a souvenir too.,334,,,
kymnkim,5,OMGosh! This needs to be brought back ASAP! What were they thinking when they got rid of this cereal!,334,,,
Gin,5,"I liked the cereal. I think of the theme song ""SMURF BERRY CRUNCH IS FUN TO EAT"" seems like everyday.",334,,,
Lucky17,5,Best ever! They really smurfed up when they took this cereal away.,334,,,
Deleo,5,"As a kid, I became addicted to this cereal. There was something about the taste of it that was unique. I never found that flavor anywhere since. I just wish they would bring the recipe back.",334,,,
ladyjay69,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  So many great morning memories with this cereal. Please bring it back or at least give us a recipe. Even my grandkids are into the Smurfs.,334,,,
cokobadonk,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  It was the best-est! So sweet and fruity... I loved all the sugar and food coloring. Bring back the goodness!,334,,,

Cerealadultkid,5,Bring back Smurf Berry Crunch!!,334,,,
scarfy,5,This cereal was the best. Way better than both Fruity Pebbles and Cap'n Crunch. It's probably my all time favorite cereal! I can taste it now. Mmmmmm Yum!,334,,,
Melissaasher35,5,Loved it! Wish they would bring it back.,334,,,
anthony-4,5,We need to petition the company to bring it back for real. Best cereal ever created hands down.,334,,,
Senator Z,5,Yeah! Hands down the best cereal of the 80's. And it would probably be the best right now as well if it was still around or brought back.,334,,,
Smurfs4evah,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Best cereal ever. I most liked the texture which seemed softer than other cereals. I thought Hannah Montana cereal from a few years ago was very similar to it.,334,,,
P.M.Z.,5,I also vote to BRING IT BACK!,334,,,
Rustee,5,"I don't care if they rename it, but PLEASE bring back the cereal! It was the best ever!",334,,,

cerealmonster,5,I thought it was yummy. Now I want my kids to try these!,334,,,

K. Day,5,I loved this cereal!,334,,,
stacilily,1,(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal was so nasty! My mom said she wasn't buying anymore fun cereal until I finished this one. The stale version was not any better. LOL!,334,,,
Kid at Heart,5,"I only got to eat this cereal at Grandma's house, as my parents would not allow any sugary cereals (we got a choice of store-brand Corn Flakes, Bran Flakes, Cheerios, or Crispy Rice). It was amazing. 'Smurfberry Crunch is fun to eat ..... a Fruity, Smurfy breakfast treat!'",334,,,
Cisco,5,I remember eating an entire box of this in one sitting as a kid. So good!,334,,,
LINDSAY,5,This freaking awesome cereal and Strawberry Shortcake cereal need to be brought back ASAP! And I mean... same recipie and same box! Get with it cereal makers of the world!,334,,,
sublimesting,5,The closest I have found to this flavor is Berry Berry Kix. It's pretty spot on but not as sweet.,334,,,
dueloe,5,My all time favorite cereal ever. It would be really awesome if Post would bring back the original recipe.,334,,,
sbc-2,5,I can't believe there are other people out there who agree that Smurf Berry Crunch was the best. Good grief that cereal was good!,334,,,
Waiting 4 Smurf,5,Bring it back. I just saw that a Smurfs 2 movie was coming out. Come on Post... perfect chance to bring back original Smurf Berry Crunch in its original recipe. Please!,334,,,

SmurfMom,5,Please bring back this cereal so my daughter can taste it! PLEASE! She's only 3 and I want her to know this taste and enjoy the stickers in the box!,334,,,
joe0750,5,I loved it. I still to this day think I smell it when I enter a room with certain air fresheners. I really miss it.,334,,,

Karl F.,5,Come on Post - the Smurfs was the best cereal ever! Time to bring it back.,334,,,
melicious,2,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I was a huge Smurf fan, but this tasted horrible. Maybe it was because I begged my mom to buy it when it first came out. But the cereal was ick (which took awhile to eat, since I didn't like it) and the only premium at the time was a cut out of Gargamel and Azrael on the back of the box.",334,,,

Cerealnut,5,There was never a cereal like it before or since and I do not know why they ever discontinued Smurfberry Crunch... oversmurfing perhaps? This cereal had the most unique fruit flavor I had ever tasted and the most overwhelmingly delicious (for berry lovers) smell when you opened that box.

lexismom,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I have to say this is by far the BEST cereal ever made. The smell the taste, oh how I love those Smurfs for making it happily.

TheOneAboveAll,5,Like others have said... I don't care what the shapes of the marshmallows are... I just want the cereal back. TMNT and Spiderman were my two favorite cereals of all time and still are.,701,,,
CerealEnthusias,5,Great!,701,,,
Bmbott,5,"This was after Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cereal... same exact cereal, though.",701,,,
The Ritty,5,I remember this cereal because it was the same as the Ninja Turtle cereal.,701,,,
Steve-Os,0,Oh Ralston. How I miss thee. They made the best cereals from the 80's and 90's. This Spiderman cereal was essentially the same as the Ninja turtles cereal. Very tasty. Too bad they don't bring this formula back and rebrand it for a new cereal.,701,,,
Tahoe JoJo,5,"Best cereal on the planet! I'd buy 1,000 boxes if I could get it again!",701,,,
spidey,5,"Thanks for the new tip on how to recreate this cereal. I have been doing the Lucky Charms + Crispix combo but will add a little sugar to try. A labor of love for this, the greatest cereal of all time. I wrote the company... they said it didn't sell well. I can't believe it. It truly was the best coming from a guy who eats more than a lot of cereal. You can buy a box on ebay just to remember the good times.",701,,,
tigerthelion,5,"A cereal that was the cornerstone of my childhood. After school, it was just cartoons, myself, and a bowl of this unrivaled masterpiece that was Spiderman cereal. The sheer thought that this cereal (and even the concept itself) went out like the dinosaurs, is only an intangible and lonely memory that everyone else feels when their cereal is off the market never to be seen again. If some miracle occurs, and this cereal returns to shelves in the form of a unicorn barfing rainbows; it still would not stop me from buying every box on the inventory list.",701,,,
ChaelaMonstah,5,"I was obsessed with this cereal as a kid. Luckily, I found that if you throw a bunch of Jet-Puft Mallow Bits (Vanilla flavored) into Crispix cereal, it tastes almost exactly the same.",701,,,
joeshmofro,5,"I had this cereal one time when I was a kid and it was so good. I wish they would bring it back, Spider-man-themed or not. It was so good.",701,,,
Missy,5,I miss it! BRING IT BACK. Please:) It doesn't have to be Spider-Man. It can be a different named cereal with the rice Chex and marshmallows - great combination. Even if its limited time. General Mills brings back monster cereal around Halloween time. Please please please :p,701,,,
Rezz,5,"I was obsessed with this cereal. It was so good. I don't care if it's Spiderman or not, but just this exact same cereal would be great! Please bring it back! It was the best, ever!",701,,,
Nick,5,"Please, please please bring back Spider-Man cereal. Or just make some and I will buy it all. lol.",701,,,
Ashlovescereal,0,"This is my favorite cereal. I can still distinctly remember the taste from so many years ago. I have found a substitute that is time consuming, but almost as good. Buy a box of Kellogg's Crispix, and Lucky Charms. Remove all the marshmallows. Put a small amount of Crispix in bowl and drizzle with honey or sprinkle with sugar. Add marshmallows and then repeat to add another layer. Pour on some milk and prepare for a ride down memory lane. I figured this out on accident and have made it numerous times now.",701,,,
DoUgY,5,Not a day goes by that I don't think about the good times this cereal and I had together.. :(,701,,,
spidey2,5,Sad I never got to try this. I love Spider-Man. Even planning a trip to NYC to see the Spider-Man musical. Wish I could bring this cereal with me!,701,,,
M.J.,5,This was best cereal I've ever had - hands down. I would kill for a box of this now.,701,,,
queenswood,5,Please bring it back! It was only around a year in my hometown but I remember liking it a lot.,701,,,
Dreadz,5,Please make this cereal again!!!! One of the best cereals I ever ate!!!,701,,,
owen1,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Best Spiderman cereal of the 4 that they had. General Mills (since they make Chex) should bring this one out when the next Spiderman movie comes out,701,,,
TheCastro,5,Do they make a comparable cereal now?,701,,,
AllAboutTaste,5,"Really wish they would make this again, I wasn't a fan of spiderman or cartoons but this cereal was delicious, it was like super-sweetened rice chex with marshmallows.",701,,,
Flip000,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved this cereal as a kid and wish it was still available because I would eat it everyday!!!!,701,,,

BBSS,5,I was making a plan called BBSS [Bring Back Sprinkle Spangles]. A plan to bring back Sprinkle Spangles. I already sent a letter to General Mills and I was hoping that you guys can make a letter about Sprinkle Spangles and send them to General Mills. Anyways that's all I like to talk about.,343,,,
SprinkleLove,5,Please bring this back! I searched for this cereal for the bulk of my childhood!,343,,,
Kinah,5,Please bring this cereal back out into the grocery stores! This is a childhood favorite of mine and I would just absolutely love to relive those memories again!,343,,,
Steve-Os,5,"This was an usual cereal, in a good way. They were shaped like stars and tasted good with sprinkles on them. It's a really unique concept for a cereal. I heard the sprinkled donut Cap'n Crunch that is currently on the market is supposed to taste similar to these. I remember loving these though.",343,,,
Spangles Lover,5,"Please bring back Sprinkle Spangles! I loved these as a kid, and even asked for a box as a Christmas present! They were so good that I used to eat them right out of the box. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!",343,,,
bethywethy17,2,(Team Breakfast Member)  I think we bought these once and my dad had to finish the box because my siblings and I thought it was gross. Lol.,343,,,
Melia,5,I need this back in my life!,343,,,
Buddy25,5,"I have been trying to figure out what I've been craving for weeks now, it's Sprinkles Spangles! I'm 25 now and it was discontinued at most when I was six. Please Please Please! Please bring it back! Or any popular 90's cereal that was so cruelly cut from our lives!",343,,,
rzzleruby,5,"I MISS THIS CEREAL!! I used to call it sprinkle cereals! As a 90s kid, this was probably the only cereal I loved eating and still remember the taste. PLEASE BRING THIS CEREAL BACK! The generation now has to try this greatness!",343,,,
MattGump,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Omg! I FOUND A MATCH! It's so funny that there is even reviews like this on here. I actually looked this up on here to show my ex what this cereal was. I love eating cereal all the time. Mainly at night for my dessert. Anyway she was bragging about a new cereal she had bought. I seen it and told her it looks like the old Sprinkle Spangles. I talked about over the last decade that was and still is my all time favorite. So I tried it and guess what... It's back baby!!! At least real darn close! They are round though with a little less sprinkles but the same taste. It's CAPTAIN CRUNCH's Sprinkled Donut Crunch. It's new so some stores might not have it yet. But Walmart has it she said. I'm so freakin' happy!,343,,,
Ray7,0,FYI... Spongebob Squarepants Fruity Splash is a new cereal made by General Mills and it TASTES JUST LIKE Sprinkle Spangles. It don't even taste fruity at all.,343,,,
FatsILLmatic,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Loved this one! ""We wish it, now General Mills needs to dish it!"" Where that dang genie when you need him!",343,,,
Beau,5,I NEED more Sprinkle Spangles. I will never forget you Sprinkle Spangles!,343,,,
pepsi_1,5,I will pay top $ for a bowl.,343,,,
squid,5,"I love this cereal! Why, oh why, did they ever take it away?! So cruel!",343,,,
Jessica,5,I wish they would bring it back too!,343,,,
Nicky Y.,5,I loved this cereal so much when I was younger. I'd pay anything for a box of it now!,343,,,
Ahumble,5,I'd buy like 100 boxes a week of this cereal if it came back. I remember being a small child and in one sitting in the morning eating the whole box!,343,,,
rjns2312,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I really wish this cereal would be put back on the shelves because unlike any other cereal this cereal had its own unique taste. I loved it and had it all the time until one day my dad and I went to go purchase and found none. My daughter and husband would love this.,343,,,
Mat,5,I would pay $50 for a box of Sprinkle Spangles right now!,343,,,
Raccoon,5,I have so many fond memories of Sprinkle Spangles. Please bring back this wonderful cereal.,343,,,
lightpinklily,5,I LOVED this cereal! My brother and I used to eat boxes and boxes of it! Wish they would bring it back!,343,,,
CdjMurphy,5,Please bring it back! This cereal was so good. I wish my kids could try it now.,343,,,
Mateo,5,This cereal was by far the best of the 90's in my book! The company should bring it back right away!,343,,,
Beanie B.,5,"Omg! My favorite! Talk about the greatest cereal in the world! Brings back my childhood memories when I used to climb the cabinet for this box. I've loved this cereal since I was seven years old! Who, what when and where can I find this box?",343,,,
SprigWheatly,4,"Back in the mid 90s, I worked for a company that made pneumatic conveying systems for solid materials. General Mills sent them over several pallets of Sprinkle Spangles for testing in their house system. They only used a small portion of what they were given, so they gave the rest to the employees. We got to bring home huge 30 gallon bags of this stuff. We had months of this cereal, and eventually got sick of it.",343,,,
popsnap,5,"This cereal is listed in 1st place in my ""dang this is awesome"" list. I WANT IT BACK! Dang it was awesome!",343,,,
Ageless Kid,0,This cereal reminded me of TWINKLES which was made by the same company.,343,,,
virtuoso09,5,"I remember eating the star shaped cereal, but couldn't remember it's name. I stumbled upon this and it came back to me. It was this cereal that left me wanting more. I wish this cereal still existed. Who do I talk to about getting the recipe?",343,,,
Claire G,5,I loved this cereal when I was a kid. I wish they would bring it back.,343,,,
yazzy,5,This was the most FANTASTIC cereal I've ever had and is the epitome of my childhood breakfast. It's just delicious and visually attractive and so is the packaging. I strongly suggest that you bring it back!,343,,,
Cindy Sue,5,This cereal was amazing. They should really bring it back. I would like my children to be able to enjoy it too.,343,,,
Blanc,5,I loved this cereal when I was younger! It is a shame it is no longer on the market. Please bring back Sprinkle Sprangles!!!,343,,,
Brandiiiiii,4,"I remember trying this cereal when I was quite little. I only remember eating the cereal and the taste of the sprinkles. I remember liking the cereal to, but that's about it.",343,,,
T.M. Luckett,4,"I remember this cereal. I vaguely remember but it makes up a part of my life I most like to remember and a taste I loved that I can't find again too often. It's a shame that I learned it's been discontinued. Oh well, at least I have memories of it.",343,,,
S. S. Ho Hum,3,I wanted to love this cereal as a kid and remember the too tough to chew sprinkles. Maybe if they had used traditional ice cream sprinkles that have a softer consistency? It was also a little too bland tasting.,343,,,
kerrin,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I vaguely remember this cereal. I remember liking it, but was it sort of vanilla flavored? I also remember the sprinkles were kind of crunchy.",343,,,
CactusHeart,4,"From what I hear, the reason this cereal was discontinued was because of not only it's dismal sales (despite their ambitious promotional efforts) but the VERY LOUD disapproval from consumers. This was NOT AT ALL a liked cereal... not by the general public anyway, and that's all the manufacturers really care about. Not little old you and me, who actually liked the cereal *lol*. Most of it's complaints were about it's namesake feature: the sprinkles. They were considered tooth-chippingly tough (not to me though, I loved the sprinkles and it's added crunch) and they were criticized as not adding anything to the cereal. Again, I disagree. IMO, that's what made them awesome. It was like 'cookie crisp' except instead of the flavor of choc. chip cookies, sprinkle spangles' flavor resembled a sugar/vanilla cookie flavor. Really good stuff.",343,,,
Spangles#1Fan,5,"When this cereal was out, it was my favorite out of every cereal i have ever tasted. I wish they never took it off the market, maybe one day it will make a come back. If not then I hope this new cookie crisp with sprinkles will taste just as good.",343,,,
tootie,0,Listen up sprinkle spangle fans General Mills has a new Cookie Crisp cereal out called Sprinkles Cookie Crisp it almost taste exactly like sprinkle spangles it's just not as sweet and has a few less sprinkles. It's not like the original but it's close enough if you are a true fan of Sprinkle Spangles -- sincerely tootie,343,,,

The Ritty,0,Never knew this existed. Sounds amazing.,1206,,,
Lindsaylou77,5,"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE... and I saw it in the store the other day grabbed what they had... now... I can't find it! Walmart here doesn't even have regular Honey Combs... what's up with that?! Kudos to Harvey's here in Waycross, GA for at least having my favorite cereal the first go around!",1206,,,
Bizarro,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  IT'S BACK!!! I'm not kidding - I was in Meijer tonight and saw it sitting on the shelf, and my heart nearly stopped. I immediately grabbed two boxes and threw them in my cart, finished my shopping, and rushed home to pour myself a bowl. Is it the same as it used to be? Honestly, I can't say with 100% certainty, as it hasn't been available since the late 1980s (to the best of my memory), but it IS most certainly delicious, unlike the Monster Cereals (which are a pale imitation of their ancestors due to an inexplicable change in formulation). Honey Comb's recipe and taste have remained largely unchanged over the years, so they really couldn't go wrong with adding strawberry flavor to it. I will say this: For the entirety of that first bowl, I felt like I was five years old again, and that is a good feeling. I had been clamoring for the return of this cereal for a VERY long time, and after being teased with the ""Strawberry Blasted"" version several years ago (which I never bought, because it's not what I wanted) I had completely given up hope that my beloved cereal would ever return. Then, with absolutely no mutterings of its return, I just happened to see it while on a random shopping trip. It's strange - this is one of the very first cereals that I can remember eating (and cereal is practically my lifeblood), but I have trouble finding people around my own age who even remember that it existed. Fret no longer, my friends - Strawberry Honeycomb is back, and now old and new generations alike can enjoy it. We have the power to make sure it stays on the shelves for good - buy as much as you can, as often as you can; tell everyone you know about it, and let Post know how much you love it!",1206,,,

Andante Hall,5,Yeeeessss! I would do anything for a limited edition of this cereal again (not mixed with regular Honeycombs - just a full box of the 1983 recipe of Strawberry Honeycombs). How many people do we need to get Post to make these again? If they did a limited edition of then these then again they would see how popular they really are.

Ruthy,5,My most favorite childhood cereal. Can still taste it in my mind.,348,,,
Warlocke,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This stuff looked like a standard corn puff type cereal, but the texture was soft and unlike any other cereal I've had since. The strawberry taste was strong, but not offensively so, and didn't have an obnoxiously artificial or chemical flavor at all. It says it's ""frosted"" but I don't remember it having a coating or being overly sweet, either. Unlike so many other cereals that get resurrected under a different name/licensed mascot, or copied by another manufacturer, I've never seen Strawberry Shortcake cereal make a reappearance of any kind. Too bad; it was a good one.",348,,,

buzzy,5,Yeah! I was so excited when my mom bought this for me. I was maybe 7 years old - just about to grow out of my Strawberry Shortcake phase - but old enough to go downstairs and make my own bowl of cereal and watch cartoons before my parents woke up. Great memories.,348,,,

ral,5,My name is Ralston. I'm a hot Ralston. This cereal is very honored to be named after me.,319,,,
G.P.,5,My husband who is 82 keeps referring to Chex mix as Shredded Ralston and I didn't realize that Ralston had been taken over by General Mill so now I can tell him he is correct. Thank you for the info.,319,,,
Jebby,3,"I am now 80 years old and I remember the jingle 'take a tip from Tom go and tell your mom Shredded Ralston can't be beat'. Then I thought 'what is Shredded Ralston'???? - a breakfast cereal but corn, oats, wheat, what???? Ohhh, Wheat Chex. Thanks.",319,,,
BEAR,4,"I grew up with Shredded Ralston, Wheaties, Rice Krispies, and other cereals of the '40's. Shredded Ralston was a favorite and I'm sorry to see it gone. Wheat Chex is all right, though.",319,,,

Fishface,3,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I was in an orphanage during in the 40's and we had Ralston. I seem to remember a hot Ralston too.

Don,5,It still has never been beat. It's a classic.,319,,,
WallyB,5,"Shredded Ralston was GREAT! Today's Wheat Chex is but a shadow of the former cereal - different flavor, different texture, somewhat similar shape.",319,,,
Paul,0,I couldn't eat it fast enough to get the box tops for the promotional items offered. Enjoyed getting the items offered on the Tom Mix radio program. Those were very special days.,319,,,

lefty,4,"I have enjoyed this cereal in the past but have not been able to find it at Walmart or Food Lion, our grocery stores. Kellogg's - if you're not going to make it available to all areas, keep it to yourself. While I'm writing, they had another cereal I enjoyed a lot, Apple Raisin Crisp but sadly, they stopped selling it also. Seems like par for the course.",1587,,,
Need More,5,"Love it! Why can't I find it anywhere? If everybody loves it, shouldn't they make more?",1587,,,
Barb S.,5,My favorite Special K ever. Can not find it anywhere Kellogg's products are sold. Bought the last four boxes at my local Walmart. This needs to be a PERMANENT ADDITION their line!,1587,,,
Pookie,5,Best new cereal hands down! Just isn't readily available. Wish that could be rectified.,1587,,,
CerealCrusher,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Definitely a delicious mix of multigrain cinnamon crunch and cooling apple (pellets of apple and calcium puree). Excellent!,1587,,,
Steve-Os,2,"I'm surprised the other reviewers liked this cereal so much. I tried it and I thought the dried apples tasted weird like they were sweetened with artificial sweetener. I'm usually an apple lover too, but this cereal didn't really do anything for me. I much prefer the standard strawberry Special K or the Blueberry. I think this cereal had a very artificial sweetener taste to it.",1587,,,
ghostballer,5,I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this cereal! It is my,1587,,,
Dan-7,5,"Finally, a Special K flavor you can really enjoy. I had soured on Special K after all these years - boring, bland. But this Apple Cinnamon Crunch was just plain delicious with a lively pretty intense apple and cinnamon flavor with just the right amount of crunch. I wish Kellogg's would make it a permanent addition the to Special K family or at least release it again in fall 2016 when I'll know to really stock up on it.",1587,,,
donnahembree,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  They took the blueberry Special K away. Not this one too. I only got to try one box. Went looking for more and couldn't find any.,1587,,,
aislinn31,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I'm so very sad this is going away! This is one of my top favorite cereals I've ever had! Please make this become PERMANENT! Cheers!,1587,,,
Grandma,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Special K Apple Cinnamon Crunch has become the apple of my eye! The taste and texture are phenomenal. Please make it a permanent addition to the Special K cereal family. It has now become my favorite and my 8 year old grandson, Gabriel loves it too. More Special K Apple Cinnamon Crunch please!",1587,,,
M.W.C.,0,Awesome. I need to find out where I can get more. The store I originally bought it from (Food Lion) does not have any more.,1587,,,
Fred H.,4,I took the last box from the shelf. Hope they add it permanently to their line.,1587,,,
Jeff-4,5,"About the best cereal I've had in a very long time. But now suddenly, I can't find it anywhere!",1587,,,
Breakfast Yum,5,Amazing! I wish they'd make this cereal permanent. It's my new favorite.,1587,,,
Macster,0,Why would they have a big cereal announcement and then we are not be able to find it ANYWHERE! What a marketing FLOP!,1587,,,
KNeeks,5,"I LOVE this cereal. Had a box and devoured it. Couldn't find it again here in the DC area but I was able to score 3 boxes at Target in Monroeville, PA this weekend!",1587,,,
Fussy Eater,5,A tasty cereal that stays crunchy in milk even for a long time. Bought one box and can't find any more anywhere. Very disappointed that it isn't readily available and a limited edition at that.,1587,,,
Very Pleased,5,I love this cereal and so does my entire family. But bad news... I'm already having trouble finding it.,1587,,,
Gram,5,My family and I loved this cereal. The cereal stayed crunchy even while in milk for a period of time. I really enjoyed this cereal and would like to get more but unable to find in a store again.,1587,,,

Nikki D.,5,Just searched to see if I could find anything about Strawberry Chex because I can never find it in the grocery store I go to. I keep looking to this day and I see that it was discontinued. Why? It was so good. Please bring it back. I love it.,1008,,,
Steph,5,"I remember buying like 6 boxes at once because my store would always run out! I remember coming home from grad school late at night and rushing into the pantry to pour a bowl of my beloved Strawberry Chex. It got to the point where I would basically eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner because it was THAT GOOD! Why would they discontinue this? A bowl of Strawberry Chex with whole milk and a splash of half & half was to die for. Okay, now I'm gonna cry! BRING IT BACK!",1008,,,
mammakitteh,5,"PLEASE! Bring back Strawberry Chex! It was the most delicious cereal I've ever had and I'm not even a big cereal lover! I think it tasted a lot better before it changed to whole grain. The original version was just pure rice, with the strawberry taste and it was very crispy crunchy. I know that my store couldn't keep it on the shelves. When they changed it to whole grain, people stopped buying it. What's wrong with having a rice-based cereal? Not everything has to be whole grain! Anyway, I miss this cereal and I wish they would bring it back!",1008,,,
Cory,5,My sister and I really want this cereal back on the shelves! I don't understand how they had low sales as good as it was.,1008,,,

bigbaby38,5,"I have been looking for this cereal for a very long time as well with no luck. I even went as far as to write the company about where I could find it. They informed me that they no longer make this cereal, yes it has been discontinued due to low sales. I asked them to please bring it back to the shelves. Lets keep our fingers crossed!!! They did suggest that I search dollar stores in my area because they shipments of the cereal that were left where distributed to dollar stores. Good luck on ur search!!",1008,,,

Bob34,5,Best Kellogg's cereal ever. Wish they would come back.,691,,,
Grumpasaurus,5,"Like other commenters, I will browse down the cereal aisle in hopes Kellogg's brought this back. I discovered they brought back a raspberry flavor, a mixed-fruit flavor, and raisin. They are nothing like the strawberry, however. I think Kellogg's is deliberately messing with me. Why bring back raspberry before strawberry?!",691,,,
StrwbrySqrs,5,"Man, this was the best cereal ever. Please bring it back.",691,,,
G. Handy,5,This was my favorite cereal. I still look for it every time I get cereal... just in case it makes a comeback. Please bring it back!,691,,,
Friday,5,Wish I could buy this again. This was my favorite cereal. Would also be okay with Mini-Wheats touch of fruit strawberry or something like it.,691,,,
Wally M.,4,I would love to see them in stores again.,691,,,
Uraism,5,My favorite cereal ever!,691,,,
Katfinzim,5,"Bite sized Shredded wheat with blueberries tastes similar, but I so want Strawberry Squares back.",691,,,
B.B. Organic,5,"The Kashi version is okay, but I really want these back! But organic!",691,,,
jei33,5,"Bring it back now! I'll personally buy the first 1,000 boxes.",691,,,

please4,5,"If I die without having Strawberry Squares cereal again, my life will have had no meaning. Please bring it back!",691,,,
Andy,4,I remember getting a stomach bug in college and watching my breakfast of Strawberry Squares cereal come back up. I never bought them again.,691,,,
Westside Roo,5,Best cereal ever! I would eat an entire box in one sitting.,691,,,
Mrs. Maybes,5,We all want to buy this Strawberry Squares cereal again. Loved them!,691,,,
jim K,5,By far the best cereal made. I'm 33 and I'd still eat 2 boxes a week if they brought it back.,691,,,
Ailo,5,"This was my favorite cereal for 2 years and then it disappeared on me. If they brought it back (same as before), I would buy 2 boxes a week. Miss it!",691,,,
mumstouch2000,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I loved this cereal! Is there ANY chance of getting it back or an equivalent to it? It didn't have all the sugar that the cereals today have and we even used to sit and eat it as a snack instead of candy and chips. Why is it all of the good things get taken off of the shelves? Please bring it back.,691,,,
tam tam,5,Bring back the Strawberry Squares! I loved them. I miss them!,691,,,
jranae,5,"I LOVED this cereal as a kid. There are nothing but positive reviews so I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why Kellogg's won't bring it back. This product is a gold mine that they refuse to tap into. Seriously! It didn't even have frosting so that is one less step in the manufacturing process that they'd have to pay for. It's like they enjoy making people suffer. And then putting out the ""Touch of Fruit"" cereal... Smite me almighty smiter!!!",691,,,
inputoutput,5,"The best cereal I ever had as a kid. Healthy enough, and not too sweet. Last time I had these was in Canada, and I was maybe 15 at the time. We should petition the White House to bring these back, or something.",691,,,
Ti Ti,5,"The BEST cereal ever made... Their attempts to make a similar product by coming out with Touch of Fruit in the Middle are sad at best. They finally came out with Raspberry, I really disliked the Mixed Berry flavor, it reminded me of cough syrup flavoring. The Raspberry is better, but definitely still too sweet with the frosting. I'd love to have my Kellogg's Strawberry Squares back!",691,,,
daniel,5,I love this cereal and I wish that there was more! I'd buy it if it came out again.,691,,,
nparham,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) I used to find the Smart Start Strawberry Squares at K-Mart but now they only have it in Blueberry. I do buy the Mixed Berry but it is frosted with sugar. Bring the unfrosted Strawberry Squares back. I would buy several boxes since they sold so fast and so hard to find. It was a good sell,let us know where we can buy them again.",691,,,
DebraLee,5,This was my favorite when I was a kid. Wish my kids could enjoy it too.,691,,,
w-muncher,5,"I loved Strawberry Squares too! I only remember being able to get them when I was visiting relatives in Indiana or Texas and I wanted them so bad that I would try and bring a box home on the plane. I don't eat much cereal normally but I am hooked on the new Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheat Touch of Fruit as it is the closest thing to the Strawberry Squares that I ever came into local contact with but it is not quite the same being a little sweeter than the original. If they ever bring them back, they should make it available in nearly all grocery stores.",691,,,
Day84,5,As a child this was the ONLY cereal I would eat. I just tried the new Frosted Mini Wheats with a touch of fruit in the middle as well. It is good! But not as amazing as I remember my old childhood favorite cereal! I really want to find this old cereal again and buy a bunch for my brother for Christmas so we can reminisce :),691,,,
Oh My My,0,Seriously!!!! Looks so good! Why is it not being made?,691,,,
steve,5,Bring back Strawberry Squares! Hear my voice! Such a great cereal!,691,,,
CLB,0,"I absolutely LOVE this cereal. I'm 20 years old, and I would seriously cry to get it when I was around 4 and 5 years old. My mother remembers it better than me, but I CAN remember it being my favorite cereal. BRING IT BACK.",691,,,
Susie,5,Kellogg's really messed up this time by taking Strawberry Squares off the market. They were great and for awhile I even bought them on line for my kids. It would have been more beneficial to put more into marketing because everyone I have talked to that ever tried them loved them.,691,,,
StrwberrySqsFan,5,I bought a box of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats Touch of Fruit in the Middle Mixed Berry yesterday - not quite the same thing but maybe it's a good sign?,691,,,
Arlie,5,"I have been looking all over for this cereal. I love it so much! This is my favorite, with Crunchy Corn Bran second. I hope to find it in the grocery soon,PLEASE!! Why must all the best items be discontinued? Gee, I wish I had a big bowl of it right now.",691,,,
TheHerron7,5,I loved strawberry squares! I have been looking for it for years now and couldn't seem to find it anywhere but now it looks like it is not being made anymore! Please bring it back!! My children are missing out on the best cereal ever made!!,691,,,
heater,0,This was one of my childhood faves! I'd beg for this one! I still love shredded wheat and the strawberry middle was just the right amount of sweetness!,691,,,
momof3,5,"Omg, my 26 year old son just called to remind me of how good the strawberry squares were after seeing a commercial for new Frosted Mini Wheats strawberry filled cereal. He continued to eat Kellogg's version til a couple of years and local grocers discontinued them. They were the best! They helped me feed nutritious food to my three kids, now health-conscious adults!!",691,,,
D-Mac,5,I remember sitting on the floor in my grandparents kitchen eating these out of the box!,691,,,
dee,5,I have been looking for this cereal. Please bring back Strawberry Squares. Please...,691,,,
sissypoo,5,"Yes, please bring it back. I only found one other kind of cereal I like. So please bring it back!!! Not sure if its the same as what they had before but I'd like to try it and see if it is that same.",691,,,

spinner,5,Awesome cereal! Please bring back Strawberry Squares. Please!,691,,,
Christy,5,I agree! You should DEFINITELY BRING BACK THIS CEREAL! It is my all time favorite! My family loves it too!,691,,,
Lvs Strwbrry Sq,5,I just emailed Kellogg's asking them to bring it back! I think everyone should and maybe they would!,691,,,
Truth,5,"Please please please bring this cereal back Kellogg's people!! I have been looking for this cereal and the name of it for the last 3 months!! I'm glad I found the name, but I want it back!!! What could one do to bring this cereal back to the shelves? Please help!!!",691,,,
D.M.G.,5,"I ate this ALL the time... breakfast, lunch, dinner... I used to be able to find it every once in awhile in Ohio just a few years ago, but Kellogg's needs to bring this back ALL THE TIME ASAP!!! My favorite, FOR SURE!!!",691,,,
Wan2,5,I loved this cereal as well! I really wish Kellogg's would bring it back. It was sooo good. Please bring it back!!!,691,,,
MacDaddy,5,I want my cereal back! My wife thinks I'm nuts but why the heck doesn't Kellogg's bring this back!,691,,,
Schuylkill,0,My childhood favorite. I found it 5 years ago selling at Walmart in Pennsylvania. I have not seen it since:(,691,,,

Will Pay,5,This was the best cereal I've ever had. I and all of us in the family enjoyed this cereal growing up. We all still look for it at the grocery market and we say we would pay anything to have it.,691,,,
Lisa,0,AGREED! I tried Smart Start strawberry filled - it's AWFUL!,691,,,
bring em back,5,This was the greatest cereal of all time. It was just the right mix of sweet/tart strawberry with wheat. I probably ate two or three whole boxes of this cereal every month growing up. I wonder if there would ever be any way to get Kellogg's to start making it again. I'd probably pay 100 bucks to have a box of this stuff!,691,,,

kevin17,3,"The taste of Sugar Crisp has changed for the worse recently. It used to be my favorite cereal, but not anymore!",351,,,
Fozzybear,0,I just want to know when Sugar Crisp became Golden Crisp.,351,,,
T. Kreinen,5,Always one of my favorites as a kid.,351,,,
oldschool,5,"Aldi Foods has a cereal called Honey Wheat Puffs which is exactly the same as Sugar Crisp and only costs about $1.90. My grandkids won't eat it but I love it. Like the old commercial said, it's handy, dandy and you can eat it like candy which is what I'm going to do when I'm done typing this.",351,,,
Joanne,3,"Who was the little boy who played Christopher Wheat in the series of Post Sugar Crisp commercials in the late 50's, early 60's? Also, who was the little girl who was always crying for help before Christopher came to the rescue? Does anyone know their names and if they did any other work in TV or the movies besides this series of commercials, which I believe were 5 in all?",351,,,
Phil G.,5,"I loved it when I was a kid (I'm sure my dentist loved it too), and still treat myself to a box every now and then 50 years later.",351,,,
Leesh75,4,Thought we were the only family to still have the musical sugar bear ornament. I remember taking it out of the box in 1986 or 87. Ours still sings and my mom still hangs it on the tree.,351,,,
Lee,0,"How do I replace the battery in the Sugar Bear ornament? I love that little guy, but he won't play any more. Still hangs on our tree, but silent.",351,,,
SugarBearMom,5,We have had Sugar Bear on our family Christmas Tree for decades! He's just started winding down and we miss his singing Jingle Bells. Thanks BearDoc for the info on the replacement battery needed! Sugar Bear will get surgery within the week and we will enjoy him for a few more decades!,351,,,
Paul in NJ,3,No one's commented on the voice actors yet. I'm pretty sure that Granny Goodwitch was voiced by June Foray.,351,,,
M.L.E.,0,"My supermarket doesn't stock Sugar Crisp or Golden Crisp cereal. Where can I find it? I'm in Wilmington, NC.",351,,,
BearDoc,0,"I could have sworn that the Sugar Bear musical ornament came out well before 1989. Anyway last year mine finally stopped playing and today I completed open heart surgery on Sugar Bear. He is once again fine (with replacement batteries Energizer 392/384 which replaces the original 192.) and will probably be playing music long after I am gone. Long live Sugar Bear, a Christmas little thing that has become a family favorite!!",351,,,
crzy_bss19,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Old Timer - Yes, Golden Crisp is the same as Sugar Crisp! There is also Honey Smacks which is also a sweetened puffed wheat cereal that is practically that same! Enjoy!",351,,,
old timer,0,"I am 66 yrs old and my doctor recommended that I eat cereal every morning. I have looked in every store for Sugar Crisp. I even ask customers if they remember it. Last night, I was shopping, and I asked a customer if she remembered it. Please tell me if the new Golden Crisp is the same as Sugar Crisp. I don't want to try to find it and not like it. I have been craving Sugar Crisp, and I can even taste it. So I would like to hear from you. Thank you.",351,,,
andyfjr51,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  The bottom ad for Post Sugar Crisp - the bears were drawn by Whittney Darrow Jr. who drew cartoons for the New Yorker Magazine. Ed Graham upscaled one of the bears a.k.a as Sugar Bear and was on the Linus the Lionhearted show.,351,,,
Mochamunchies89,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I think this is my mom's favorite cereal because every time I have a box she eats my cereal and a few days later my box is empty. I love this cereal. But I can no longer find it at Safeway. The only places I know that sell it are Giants, and maybe Fresh and Greens... oh and Shoppers might have it. Shoppers always has all the cool yummy cereals.",351,,,
T.T.,4,"I just read the comment from Paw Paw about the musical sugar Santa bear he got in 1989. I also got one of the Santa bears in a box of cereal in 1989, and he still plays the three songs like it did back then. These bears were made to last. I've been enjoying mine every year and hope he lasts for another 22 years. T.T. in Texas",351,,,
Papaw,0,"Shortly before Christmas 1989, we bought a box of Sugar Crisps in an Army Commissary in Utah. The box contained a Sugar Bear Musical Ornament. Sugar Bear is dressed in a Santa Claus suit. Well here it is Christmas-time 2011. It is 22 years later and we still have it and the music still plays. By the way, it plays jingle bells. I find that simply amazing. I just thought I would share this with you.",351,,,
Cincinnati Kid,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Long before ""Sugar Bear"" came along to tout this cereal, there were three little bears in the ads. One would say, ""For cereal, it's dandy"" while another would state ""for snacks, it's so handy"" and the third would remark, ""or eat it like candy"". There seemed to be no concern for promoting the sugar content of the product.",351,,,
ageless kid,0,"The strangest thing about this product is that I remember... in 1967... Post put the word ""Super"" on top of the ""Sugar Crisp"" name, then put an ""X"" over the ""14"" in ""14 ounces"" and replaced it for this box with ""now 15..."" to show that the package contains ""15 ounces"" and finally... this sign on the front of the box made it look to me like the cereal was ""vitamin new"" because they added more vitamins to the product.",351,,,
cerealman,0,"I live in Jacksonville, FL and can't seem to find Sugar Crisp cereal anywhere. I've been to Publix, Winn Dixie, Walmart. Anyone out there know where to get them?",351,,,
frustrated,0,"My comments are: What the ""H"" are you doing to my cereal? The prices have gone sky high and you took the Jumbo size off the shelves and are trying to gouge the consumer by selling a smaller box for the same price as the Jumbo box and call it ""Family Size"". Who is the Rocket Scientist that thought that one up? I feel gouged!!!! - Can't afford this favorite anymore! Frustrated in Alberta Canada",351,,,
Hayti,5,"I remember when this cereal first came out in 1949. I was 11 years old and we shopped at a Kroger Store down in the bootheel town of Hayti, Missouri. The store gave away free samples of Sugar Crisp for a few days and I thought it was the best tasting cereal ever. A cereal already covered with sugar - Wow - I loved it. Don't know what made me think of it, but I looked it up, and there it is - And now I remember the Sugar Bear commercials. Nostalgia.",351,,,
lucy brown,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I wish the days still lived... that for sharing!,351,,,
Q4Jeffery,0,Hi jeffery i was hoping you could tell me if the sugar crisp bear came in the pink & blue creamer like the bear sugar shaker I know the clown came in the pink blue creamer. My wife had it as a child and can't remember and is on the hunt for it. thanks.,351,,,
Post lover,0,Golden Crisp is alive and well! In fact Sugar Bear has just undergone a character redesign in the states and will be making his debut on boxes in a few months! The box backs will have a special tribute to Sugar Bear's history so keep an eye out for this special collector's box.,351,,,
Little Bob,5,I still love it!,351,,,
SK-Canada,5,"This is one of my favorite cereals! I have not been able to find it on the grocery store shelves for 2 months now. I live in SK, Canada. Did they quit making it?",351,,,
bonita,5,Almost as good as Honey Smacks!,351,,,
Sjors,4,A litle too sweet but otherwise a very good cereal.,351,,,

Andy,5,Comment under review by Mr Breakfast. Should appear within 24 hours.,353,,,
frankie,5,Best cereal ever. I lived on it. I am so sorry they don't make it anymore. Kids would love it!,353,,,
Corrina,5,"My favorite cereal of all times. Why don't they bring them back? Sugar Jets were the most satisfying for a snack a night. Loved, loved them.",353,,,
Jimbo700,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Rose, who wrote earlier about the Sugar Jets song, 'I'm hungry I'm hungry for good things to eat...' nailed the jingle. I, too have been searching for years!",353,,,
Jet,5,"I have had the nickname 'Jet' for 60+ years because I loved this cereal. I was somewhat precocious and could recite my name, address and phone",353,,,
The Saint,4,Does anyone remember the early commercials for Sugar Jets? The kid eats the cereal and flies off into the wild blue yonder. I made my mom hold the kitchen door open while I ate my cereal. My earliest lesson in critical thinking skills.,353,,,
Postman,0,What is the difference between Jets and Sugar Jets Cereals?,353,,,
Mho,5,"The original Sugar Jets, early 1950's version... My Favorite as a kid. I literally cut my teeth on them!",353,,,
Rose,0,"I've been looking for the Sugar Jets song for years, especially the last line: 'I'm hungry, I'm hungry for good things to eat; for Sugar Jets, Sugar Jets, toasted treat. I eat Sugar Jets, the triple treat, ???????.' Anybody remember this?",353,,,
PCPilgrim,5,My favorite as a kid. I still keep looking for them. :-),353,,,
mr music,5,"Loved them as a kid and would buy them! Except I recall them looking like KIX but brown or redish & round. PS General Mills... be smart and always label your products with ""PRODUCT OF:"" Because ""DISTRIBUTED BY:"" IS NO LONGER WORTH ANYTHING!",353,,,
Lars,5,"Still a massively favorite memory of childhood, and yes, I would definitely buy them again, even though I'm diabetic now. I'd ration myself to a quarter-serving, if I had to, just to get that taste and texture and crunch again!",353,,,
James L.,5,Best cereal I ever had... Don't know why it went away... I'm ready to buy it again.,353,,,
Gentleman69,5,This was the best cereal ever. Bring them back. I am 69 and I would eat them now.,353,,,
S. Street,5,I really enjoyed Jets cereal. They were good with milk or dry right out of the box. I miss them and hope they come back.,353,,,
Debbie M.,5,"I had this cereal in California in 1956. It came in a variety pack with Mix and Trix, but the Jets were the best. Wish they still had them.",353,,,
Okkie,5,Best ever... don't know why it went away. I'm ready to buy it again if it ever comes back. Fingers crossed.,353,,,
Nioxs,5,I used to live on these!,353,,,
M. Richardson,5,Haven't seen these since the 1960s. My favorite cereal when I was a kid. Seems they disappeared sometime in the mid-to-late 1960s.,353,,,
Nini,5,They need to bring these back. Best cereal ever. Ask anyone who remembers them.,353,,,
Common Blaster,5,I still think about this cereal every once in a while and I am nearly 72! Sugar Jets is still my favorite after all these years. It would be a real treat to have Sugar Jets available once again.,353,,,
Sophie,5,I loved this cereal as a child.,353,,,
teddyboy,5,I am 66. Sugar Jets and Rice Krinkles were great tasting and popular. Why they ever stopped making them still blows my mind. Bring them back even if Rice Krinkles stuck together in summer weather. Both cereals are better than what they have out now. I'm still trim and I ate tons of cereal.,353,,,
CharlieC,5,Never found another cereal that I liked so much.,353,,,
LauraF,5,"I loved, loved this cereal. I would buy it in a heartbeat if was the same recipe as the original. Best cold cereal I've eaten.",353,,,
sauce,5,General Mills needs to bring Sugar Jets Cereal back!,353,,,
Michael Galileo,5,I too find Honey Nut Cheerios to be very close to the taste Jets.,353,,,
Babyboomer,5,All-time favorite cereal. Bring Back Jets!,353,,,
Memaw,5,I was able to find Jets in Canada in 1975. Tasted just the same. Bring it back!,353,,,
Stambaub,5,In its original configuration... this was the BEST cold cereal ever!,353,,,
J Art,5,"As they chant in the Meadowlands, J-E-T-S Jets! Jets! Jets! (from Buffalo, home of da Bills) - little brown spheres of crunchy oat-y sweetness! Tops in taste! Great when fresh-poured....great after sogging out too! Like @Bill52 said, bring 'em back, if only for a while! We boomers would be delighted!",353,,,
I. Am Sam,5,"I remembered that I loved the taste, but I'd forgotten about the space-themed shapes. Thanks for the memories guys!",353,,,
D.J. #4,5,Thinking about Jets takes me back to those uncomplicated childhood days of the 50's. I miss that cereal!,353,,,
Mountain Mama,5,Thanks to whoever said that Honey Nut Cheerios was the closest thing to Sugar Jets. I bought my husband Honey Nut Cheerios and he said they were VERY close to Sugar Jets. Has anyone tried Sugar Coated Kix and are they close to Sugar Jets? Thanks!,353,,,
Charlie Chan,5,"At 66 years old, I've told my kids for MANY years that all I want for Christmas, birthday-whatever is a box of Sugar Jets. No modifications to the original ingredients. I'd live on Sugar Jets and die happy.",353,,,
P.J.J.,5,Best ever! Don't know why it went away. I'm ready to buy it again.,353,,,
leoneon,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Probably the reason I now have type 2 diabetes is the hundreds of Jets boxes I ate as a child in the 50's!,353,,,
Kevin77,5,I miss Jets! I miss Jets! I miss Jets! Don't make me say it a fourth time.,353,,,
lulu,5,I loved my Jets! My all-time favorite.,353,,,
Krikett,5,Bring back Jets! I'm tired of my husband complaining about not having them!,353,,,
Bill52,5,"My favorite cereal of all time. I have never found a better tasting cereal. Would love to have them bring it back, even for a short time. They would have no trouble selling it for a short time. Baby boomers would purchase it. I would buy 100 boxes to give to family and friends. Loved those Jets! Bill",353,,,
tedkin,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Absolutely my favorite. Would be great to bring them back. Or find something that tastes the same.,353,,,
Janey,5,Yes! Yes! I join with everyone here to say 'Bring back Jets!!!',353,,,
Salt,5,"One of the best cereals of all time, also included in my childhood. The little orange specks in the coating always had me puzzled to what exactly they were, vitamins maybe? Great to eat in the bowl or right out of the box. Would be awesome to bring them back.",353,,,
G.P. of KC,5,I loved Sugar Jets as a small child. Please please bring it back so I can try it one more time.,353,,,
JetsFan2,5,The best cereal ever! I also remember the taste. I agree... bring them back. Sugar isn't really that bad for you!,353,,,
Bigiron383,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  So is this different from Jets cereal? The shape tipped me off. I love the taste. Bring 'em back!,353,,,
D.G.,5,"This is great because Sugar Jets is always the cereal I remember as being absolutely delicious too and is my all-time favorite. Although they were shaped like Kix, they were nothing like them. They were made from oats, not corn. It wasn't until later they made them ""space-age shapes"". I can still remember, after over 50 years, exactly what they tasted like.",353,,,
J.W.,5,"As late as the mid-70's, I found some Jets at a little grocery store in my hometown in Texas, and bought up every box they had. I don't know how old their inventory was, nor did I care! I was just glad to find some, and I enjoyed every bite. If Jets were still available, I'd eat a bowl every morning (or night)! -JW",353,,,
Phil G.,5,"The closest I've found to Jets is Frosted Cheerios, but it's still not the same. Bring back Jets!",353,,,
Team Jets,5,Loved this cereal as a kid in 50's and 60's. Would love for it to come back. Replacing Kix.,353,,,
Frannie P.,5,My favorite cereal ever.,353,,,
relic from 1950,5,"Jets were a real treat when I was a child in Connecticut. When my family moved to Fort Lauderdale in 1957, Jets could not be found. I am surprised to read that Jets were made from Kix, because Kix was the worst thing I ever tasted.",353,,,
chris62,5,"I would love to see Jets back on the grocery shelf again. I loved this cereal when first introduced back in the 50's. Where did they go? With all the comments and feedback, why don't they bring them back and let us remember about the good old days. It will ALWAYS be my all time favorite cereal of all time and I am 62 yrs. old. Old habits never die. Please, please bring them back. I know they will be a big seller.",353,,,
Hunywil,5,My favorite childhood cereal... can still remember the taste sensation... but everything tasted better when I was five... wonder how it would stack up today against Cap'n Crunch?,353,,,
bob b.,5,Great tasting and it never lost it's crunch!,353,,,
Kay,5,"This was my favorite cereal when I was little. I wish they still made it. I don't care at all that it wasn't 'healthy', it was awesome! I can still remember what they taste like and there is nothing else that comes close.",353,,,
Jackie G.,5,I remember when I was about 4 or 5 in 1954 - my mom would buy me a box of JETS. They were wonderful.,353,,,
CalicoSilk,5,"I want this cereal to make a come back, NOW.",353,,,
David H.,5,I also remember the taste. It is embedded in my brain. I've looked around for something else that might taste the same. But there's nothing out there. I wish they would bring them back.,353,,,
M.E.C.,5,Please bring back Jets cereal. One of the first TV commercials I remember on the first black and white TV my parents owned in the 1950's.,353,,,
Munny0,5,I still dream about them. I remember the taste and the crunch. If only they could bring them back!,353,,,
vpwinkler,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  The best ever. How can you go wrong with sugar coated sugar. All those Saturday mornings... I remember them well. With milk or straight out of the box. 11 out of 10!,353,,,
Steve P.,5,"I agree. I loved them. Closest cereal (very close) is Honey-Nut Cheerios. But even closer is Trader Joes Honey O's. My wife buys several boxes at a time, I go through them so fast. - Steve P.",353,,,
D.T.,5,I agreee! Best Cereal Ever! I always think about Sugar Jets and can still taste them. I would eat them for lunch and dinner if I could find them again. They always get rid of the best :-( Please bring them back. PLEASE!,353,,,
J.P.,5,Best ever! Nothing else to say.,353,,,
tcat11,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) Best cereal ever. However, you have to be at least 47 years old to even remember them.",353,,,
Jack,5,Sugar Jets were the best. I know that they would be very popular again if they were brought back.,353,,,
I Love Jets,5,I think about the Jets cereal all the time. Wish we could still get them. Loved the taste. Is there anything on the market today that is comparable to them? If so what are they? Nothing could describe the taste.,353,,,
Miss my Jets,5,"Oh how I want some right now! I'll pay you whatever you want, just bring back my Sugar Jets!",353,,,
Rick9,5,Bring Sugar Jets back to market. I absolutely loved this cereal growing up in the 1950s.,353,,,
v.b.,5,This was the best cereal I have ever eaten. I will never forget that taste. I hope they can bring them back even if only for a little time. PLEASE!,353,,,
jada1122,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I have been thinking about my childhood cereal called Jets for some time. If I were still eating them I think it will still be by favorite cereal to this very day. Is there a company that still makes the cereal called Jets - if so please let me know where to order. Would love to take that that trip down memory lane. Thanks!,353,,,
Elgin,5,I am now 65 years old and I still think about Sugar Jets at least once a week.,353,,,
franz f.,4,"I fully agree with those who have already responded. If I could, I'd buy a box today. The broken pieces at the bottom of the box were ""finger lickin' good!""",353,,,
Stinky,5,"Jets were my favorite - little hollow balls that collapsed in your mouth, until they changed them to hard little Shapes from Space. It's all in the texture.",353,,,
Willy T,5,My favorite cereal of all time also. My brother and I could finish the box in one day!,353,,,
Suzanne,5,"Wasn't part of the jingle ""Sugar Jets, Sugar Jets, good oats and wheat""? I really loved them.",353,,,
Stay Good,5,"Sugar Jets were the Best. If they remake them, please make them the same. Not politically correct with less sugar. Same things with Sugar Pops. Since they cut the sugar they suck. Am I right?",353,,,
DS1950,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I am a top exec at General Mills and I'll make sure they look into bringing back for a limited time your favorite cereal, Sugar Jets. Cross your fingers!!!",353,,,
Ed60,5,I wish they would bring them back. I have good memories of this cereal and childhood.,353,,,
Munchies,5,"Sugar Jets were indeed fantastic. I've recently started eating Frosted Cheerios, which are basically the same (oats), but lacking the space-age shapes.",353,,,
JLundell,5,"What ""FTI"" said. Jets (oats) were not Kix (corn). And the second incarnation of Jets, more or less Alpha Bits in airplane shapes, were not Jets either. Shame!",353,,,
Jet Propelled,5,"With all of the protests going on in today's world, why not add one more to convince General Mills to bring back this cereal. WE WANT OUR SUGAR JETS!!!",353,,,
Truthslinger,5,I grew up eating this cereal! I still am not able to comprehend why it wasn't selling well enough to stay on the market! I LOVED this stuff and still do! I would buy a box TODAY!,353,,,
wosmanskygeorge,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Why and when did they discontinue my all time favorite cereal? In this day of ""retro"" and ""throwback"" - it would be great if G/M brought this great cereal back even for a limited time. I would buy it and enjoy it again!",353,,,
dewyw,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Sugar Jets were great. I wish they could bring them back for a limited time too. I would get them for sure. Does anyone know where one can get pics or posters of a Sugar Jets box or advertisements?,353,,,

Marty Peterson,0,"This is my favorite cereal. I really want General Mills to bring it back. I like the ball shaped Jets much better than the plane shaped jets. Is Jets the same as Sugar Jets.

J. Bay,5,My all time favorite... I wish they still made it.,353,,,
F. T. I.,5,"Are not JETS the same as Sugar Jets? The former was made of Oats and malted wheat. However the description above compares the latter to KIX witch was a corn meal product. I loved JETS see my revues under ""J"" for JETS.",353,,,
ShellyLovesJets,5,"The comment by larryXcop hit the nail right on the head! As a fellow BOOMER, I don't know why all the cereal companies, not just GM, would pass up an opportunity to cash in on nostalgia. I would love to have a chance to savor my old favorites, if only for a limited time. In fact, they could market as just that - Limited Edition BOOMER Favorites!!",353,,,

larryXcop,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Thank You ALL, (fellow BOOMERS), for making me feel like I'm not the only nostalgic sap out there clamoring for GM to return our beloved ""Sugar JETS"" to store shelves... Don't know if they truly realize the the biggest/fastest growing demographic are us Boomers and there's a virtual gold mine out there for the companies that are willing to satiate our taste for the past!

k.k.,5,I loved Jets!! I'm pretty sure if they brought them back they'd sell off the selves. Someone needs to tell them to start making them again. Maybe I will :),353,,,
Fearless,5,"One of the first of my favorite products to be discontinued -- a trend that continues to this day. KP, Wisconsin",353,,,
GeorgetheRunner,5,"The best part of Jets was they were coated with something shiny that made them float on top of the milk in your cereal bowl. They did not get soggy. If you pushed them down under the milk with your spoon, they would pop back up to the top. Awesome! I could play with my breakfast food for a long time and be late for school. Now I just eat Cheerios and Oatmeal because it is good for my cholesterol. I hope when I get sent to a nursing home, they serve Jets and I can be a kid again.",353,,,
old guy,5,I would still buy it if it was in the store and I'm 60 years old now. It was my favorite.,353,,,

I don't eat the white processed sugar and I drink a lot of milk and to be honest the first time I had the Sunflakes I knew I was in heaven. It put Kellogg's frosted flakes to shame.

M. Hudspeth,5,"I ate Quisp when it first came out. Later, when I couldn't find that, I found Sweet Crunch. It was the same thing! I bought many bags of it. It never went stale at my house.

I occasionally had it with milk. Most often, I just ate it dry out of a cup. It made a great snack - like chips. Made it last longer too. Quaker, bring back the purple bags with the yellow gold inside! Sweet Crunch/Quisp RULES!",1177,,,

Carol,5,Team was my favorite cereal! I'm craving some right now! Please bring it back. It was so tasty without being too sweet.,763,,,
Richard_FM,0,I remember this was sold in the UK in the late 1980s with adverts featuring The Flintstones. It wasn't around for long though.,763,,,
S.H.,5,Bring it back!,763,,,
Sean,5,"I enjoyed Team greatly for the relatively short time period when it was available here in Canada. I was watching old commercials on YouTube recently and I began to think 'what was that one multigrain cereal that was really crunchy - oh, right, Team!' It was hearty and very tasty, and I think it would go over a treat today if the company that owns the license revived it. Until then, I've hacked my own cereal mix that tastes the closest to it - equal parts Honey Nut Cheerios, Corn Flakes, and Rice Krispies.",763,,,
MrMustard,4,(Team Breakfast Member)  Another simple grain cereal that is gone. Hopefully this 'dried fruit' and 'nuts' in cereal phase will pass and they can bring back the simple stuff.,763,,,
cbralich,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I have been wanting this cereal for years! I looked everywhere and finally realized they stopped making it a long time ago. BRING IT BACK! It was a loved cereal! So great tasting, nutritious, and it really did keep its crunch! There is no other cereal out there as good. Please bring it back!",763,,,
GreatGranny,5,"I am 70 years old this year. Every time I eat cereal, I wish it was Team. I hope they bring it back in my lifetime.",763,,,
Flash,5,Love this cereal. Please bring it back. I'm waiting!,763,,,
Beef LoMein,4,"As I remember these, they were really flavorful without being notably sweet. They really did keep their crunch in milk, and were a real favorite with me and my brothers when we were kids.",763,,,
A1 Team Fan,5,Team Flakes was such a great tasting cereal. WHY did Nabisco discontinue it? A lot of us want it back. It would go over great. It was my very favorite. They should bring it back for a limited time (advertise it to let us know). See how it goes.,763,,,
Stevie,5,I wish they would bring it back! It was the best cereal I ever had.,763,,,
Nazz-2,5,Best cereal EVER. Nothing today or ever compares to it. I have tried everything in an effort to find something comparable. Nothing. I hardly eat any cereal anymore since we lost this product. Bring it back and I'll buy it in bulk. My kids need to know what a great cereal tastes like.,763,,,
Harry-6,5,"Nabisco stopped making Team Flakes just as the multi-grain craze in America was starting, Duh? Talk about short sighted thinking. In my way of thinking, it is still better then any other choice. They don't even need to change the box art. Is anyone there listening?",763,,,
Rick Stix,5,"Bring it back. Please! Please, bring it back.",763,,,
TheoH,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Bring back TEAM for heaven's sake!,763,,,
Cerealcrazy,5,"I love just about every kind of cereal there is except chocolate ones. I still crave the unique flavor and texture of Team. There's just nothing quite like it, but I wish there was!",763,,,
Cindy8,5,I loved this cereal and miss it so much!,763,,,
Vince,5,"I loved this cereal as a child - unique texture and flavor, without tons of sugar or artificial flavors - stayed somewhat crunchy (crispy rice embedded in the flakes) in milk. I'd buy again if Post could see their way to bringing it back. The only cereal that compared was Kellogg's Product 19.",763,,,
Maggie Z.,5,We loved Team flakes and would like to see them in the stores again so we can enjoy it.,763,,,
LoveTeam,5,Bring the bestest cereal back!!,763,,,
Yumarama,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I really liked this cereal as it was, true to their promotions, able to stay crunchy in milk. (I don't want to know what chemical voodoo they did to make it do so!) And the flavor was really good. It was probably my fave ""adult"" cereal and I was decidedly bothered when I was unable to find it in stores any more. Nabisco getting chopped up and sold off to Kraft/Post was not a great thing, in my books.",763,,,
Teamfan,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  It is remarkable that after 21 years people are still craving the distinct flavor and crunch of the little flakes. It was my favorite cereal as a child. My mother still craves them. I do also. She has attempted unsuccessfully to find a substitute. I have tried and failed as well. Miss it greatly. POST bought out Nabisco cereals. You can contact them at postfoods.com. Perhaps if enough requests are made, POST will start making Team again or at least let us know if it made under a different name in another county.",763,,,
Chopz,5,Do they make Team Flakes cereal anymore? Really liked it when I could find it.,763,,,
DreamTeam,0,I loved Team cereal. I tried it in 1954 when I was 10 years old. I loved it all through the 60s and I to the 70s and 80s. I never found out that it was discontinued until the grocery store where I asked about it told me they could no longer get the cereal. I have tried to no avail to find out why Nabisco discontinued the cereal. They never answered my queries.,763,,,
joe9,0,Why would they take something that was that great off the market. Come on Nabisco!,763,,,
Team Kellie,5,"I'm not a big cereal person. When I was a kid Team Flakes Cereal was the only cereal I ate. I have looked and tried other cereals. Nothing comes close. If it came back, it would be my breakfast every day.",763,,,
grecomic,5,"I remember this as one of my father's 'adult' cereals, and one of the few I actually liked as a kid! I can't remember the taste exactly but I think it managed to have a great taste even if might have contained less sugar than certain 'sport' cereals nowadays!",763,,,
Jay5,5,Team was favorite cereal for many years.,763,,,
SexyKitty,5,"Please bring back Team Flakes. Like many others, I also loved them. My friend also loved them. The taste, the crunch, yyuuummmmm.",763,,,
Jilly,5,"Bring back the Team please! They stayed crunchy, the multi-grain was actually good for you! I could get a petition going, many of my friends also want them back!",763,,,
Jen,5,I want Team Flakes back! They were so very good!,763,,,
jo100,0,I miss it too. It's the only cereal I really ever liked.,763,,,
chethoff,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Team was my favorite flake. I contacted Nabisco (Kraft) (Unilever) and was told that they no longer make cereals. They did own Post, which was sold to Nestle. Can anyone follow this? Anyway, maybe Nestle can reissue these wonderful flakes.",763,,,
CatButler,5,"Team was awesome, great taste and it stayed crunchy in milk.",763,,,
G. Boham,0,Please bring back TEAM Cereal! It was the greatest! Thank you!,763,,,
dianneC,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Team was my all time favorite cereal. I miss it.,763,,,
Capt. America,5,Hello! Nabisco Hello! Best cereal ever! Is it really that hard? Bring it back!,763,,,
Lisa1958,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I contacted Kraft.com. Go to the bottom of the page to ""Contact"" and send them a message if you'd like to see Team Flakes make a comeback. I asked them to bring back my beloved Team Flakes, crunchy, delicious and nutritious. What more could you ask for?",763,,,
Raj,5,This was the best cereal. Please bring it back.,763,,,
In Mississippi,5,I could eat half a box of TEAM flakes in one meal! Please bring them back.,763,,,
craig,5,"I wish Team cereal would be produced once again, it was an awesome, delicious cereal and it needs to make a comeback since our society is preaching healthy and lots of fiber. Please bring Team back. Please!",763,,,
r.v.h.,5,There hasn't been any better cereal before or since Team Flakes. I miss it a lot.,763,,,
datsuntech,0,This was and still is my favorite cereal.,763,,,
Bell,5,I would love to see Team cereal back on the grocery shelves. I'm sure it would be a hit again with baby boomers.,763,,,
TEAM Fan,5,I would like see TEAM cereal make a comeback. It was the best as far as I'm concerned.,763,,,
yvette,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  With all the multi grain cereals out there why in the world would they pull Team Flakes off the market. I have been looking for it for years... you would think they would bring it back, after all it was the first ever multi grain cereal and it rocked all of our worlds... crunchy till the end it was and still is awesome!!! BRING IT BACK! BRING IT BACK!",763,,,
Eve71,5,This is the BEST cereal ever made... when will it come back? My brother and I have been on a quest to find Team for years!!!,763,,,
msclassicalpian,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Team needs to come back. This remains my absolute favourite cereal of all time. I have been on a quest to find a cereal similar to Team, but never came close.",763,,,
seeker,5,"The best breakfast, lunch or dinner besides apple jacks or pops. I could eat a box right now. Might of fact, I will because we have 2 boxes right now. So see ya later frosted flaker.",763,,,
blueconversechucks,5,This cereal is listed in two different locations on the top 200 (,763,,,
Jake,5,My favorite of all time!,763,,,
ame,5,The absolute best cereal of all time.,763,,,
AndeKT,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Yes! Please bring back Team. My five siblings, Mom and Dad all loved the tasty crunch of this cereal. We kids grew up on the yummy stuff. Please bring back that wonderful memory.",763,,,
Paul,5,"Great tasting cereal. Please bring it back. The cereal tasted excellent with bananas and milk. Stayed crunchy along time. As I remember, it also was superb crushed and used as a chicken batter.",763,,,
saadie,5,Please bring back Team Cereal!,763,,,
IreneD,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Another brother & sister favorite. It had a touch of sweetness along with that amazing combo of grains. The flavor was almost duplicated in a current cereal, Curves (with girl on the box wearing green sweater). I think that's discontinued now but I bought a ton of boxes on clearance wherever I could find them.",763,,,
Jason,5,My grandmother ate Team flakes every morning and I would eat it whenever I stayed at her house. I loved it.,763,,,
teamtopgun,5,"I completely agree with captaincrunch! Not only was this cereal, topped with carefully sliced bananas, one of the staples of my family's breakfast menu (I'm craving a bowl right now), but it was also the key ingredient in some awesome cookies! They've GOT to bring it back.......",763,,,
captaincrunch,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Why isn't this cereal being made anymore??? My sister and I lived on this cereal and we can't believe that we can't find Team anywhere!! This is one of the best cereals I've ever tasted, how many nights did we come home late from a party and I'd sit with Mary Lou, Jim, Coco and a bowl of Team flakes and shoot the breeze... pity it's gone but the pictures bring back great memories of my mom's little kitchen...",763,,,

TeamC2,5,I loved Team Cheerios! Please bring them back!,369,,,
TCPower3,5,Team Cheerios was awesome! Just the right mixture of brown sugar and frosted sweetness in a whole grain cereal. The amateur high school teams featured on the back of the box were cool too. Teams were selected based on their on the field success AND their off the field good deeds in the community. A great example of companies promoting good while doing good business.,369,,,
Yogo,5,I want it back! Team Cheerios was awesome. Just enough sweetness for a good morning breakfast. I look for them every time I shop for groceries. Hope to see them soon.,369,,,

LaRaile,5,I loved this Team Cheerios! I wish they would bring this one back,369,,,

L Boogie,5,I loved Team Cheerios. I vote for them to bring it back now!,369,,,
bessie,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My son, who was 6 in 1997, says this is the best cereal he has ever eaten. He is always asking me to buy it for him but I can't find it anywhere.

USMCjedi,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal came out when I was 7 years old, I haven't thought of it for close to 14 years... I'm so unhappy that it is no longer available. And I shall have a special place in my stomach for this cereal for the rest of my life.",369,,,

TeamFlakeJunkie,5,Best cereal of all time! Why do they stop making things that people like so much?,762,,,

Tim,5,"It simply was the best tasting cereal ever, and stayed crispy in milk longer than any other flakes. The demand is out there - bring it back!",762,,,

bruce k.,5,"I think Team Flakes was indeed the BEST cereal that was on the market and I would love to see Nabisco bring it back on the market. I don't even eat breakfast any more. But I am pretty sure I might start up again if Team Flakes was brought back. Of course they would have to be ""just like"" they use to be. Even if I didn't eat them at breakfast time, I would find time to get them in some part of the day. I can remember my mama not being able to get me to eat in the morning until Team Flakes entered my life... incredible cereal! Miss them and haven't found anything to come close to being as good.

DAG,5,"I grew up on Team flakes. There are few things in life I miss (now gone) due to government safety, product overload or stupid corporate greed. A few years after Team flakes were removed, I walked into the Nabisco Plant in Southern California. I was told that the product was not profitable! And was never to return! To this day I buy very few cereals. Nothing compares to the simple Team Flakes. There are no substitutes! Given we're in a day of $4 a box cereals, Team sold for 75 cents a box back in the late 1970's. So how do ""healthy"" cereals stay on the market? There may well be 400 plus brands/types of cereals on the market today many I'm sure not worthy of shelf space.",762,,,

rkade111,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I'm giving Team Flakes an awesome rating. Around 1990, I had trouble finding Team at the supermarket. I special ordered cases of Team several times from a market in the West Hartford area. I loved this cereal so much. It stayed crunchy in milk. The combination of the grains seemingly made the flakes taste better then any other flake. I think the lack of marketing by Nabisco hurt the cereal, since there are a core of people that obviously love it. The Kraft company is responsible for the disappearance of Team. I spoke with a rep. there years back and was told that it was not produced because it was a weak seller. I would guess that they hold the rights. Kraft has a big reputation of looking after their finances over being a health-conscious company. Get with the times Kraft!",762,,,

fortified,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Rice, corn, wheat and oats. The crunchy ""bubbles"" in those flakes! Team Flakes were the best ever! That was Nabisco's worst corporate mistake in decades by discontinuing retail sales of a delicious, healthy cereal. Shame on you, Nabisco!",762,,,

Oat Flake Lover,4,"This was not my favorite cereal, however it was good enough to be in my rotation of cereals when I was a kid in the 60''s. It was better than a lot of cereal that is out there now in the markets.",762,,,
TEAMLeader,5,"I agree. The best cereal I've ever had, my all-time favorite. So of course it's gone now.",762,,,
Crunchster,5,This was an awesome cereal. I miss it. :(,762,,,
zovia,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Team Flakes was one of the best cereals I have ever eaten. I wish Nabisco would bring them back.,762,,,

Johnny T-800,5,"I grew up a massive Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan. And at 37 in 2020, I'm still a massive fan. Even sporting a Raphael tattoo. So naturally I wanted this cereal and I can still remember loving this cereal. Sadly I don't have the turtle bowls that came with some boxes anymore.",370,,,
CaptainA,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I've been a huge Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan It's my other favorite eighties cartoon show. I would play the video games and watch the cartoon show. I have the DVDs of it. I also have the comic books and the action figures and vehicles of it and t-shirts and I'm hoping that there will be more new video games and comic books and action figures of the original and new cartoon show.,370,,,
optimus,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the cereal.,370,,,
captain a7,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cereal was so awesome. I've had it since I was seven back in 1989 and my favorite Ninja Turtle happens to be Leonardo. He knows how to lead the Ninja Turtles and he's a great and brave swordsman and they know how to take down the shredder, the foot soldiers and evil mutants that would attack the city.",370,,,
TheOneAboveAll,5,This was my favorite cereal of all time and as far as I know there has never been another cereal like it aside from the Spider-man Cereal from the 90's... my other favorite cereal of all time!,370,,,
Warlocke,3,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I was a massive TMNT fan, back when this came out, but even that couldn't get me to eat more than one box of this stuff. It was literally just a mediocre Rice Chex knockoff, with marshmallows. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't anything to write home about, either. Thoroughly average.",370,,,
Shockice,3,"It was a great concept for a cereal but had a terrible flaw in the final product. It was similar to Rice Chex cereal but with sweetness added and typical cereal marshmallows you'd find in Lucky Charms. However, the rice cereal would very quickly adsorb the milk, causing the cereal to fall apart, leaving you with a soggy mushy mess. It was okay if you could eat it very quickly in small portions.",370,,,
Sifuchuck,0,I never tried it. I have an unopened sealed box of TMNT cereal from 1990 but I don't really want to open it now in 2018.,370,,,
A. Mann,5,I wish I could eat it again. It's my favorite cereal EVER.,370,,,
80s Kid,5,"My FAVORITE tasting cereal. I was born in 78, child of 80s cartoons, dozens of great cereals, but when this came out, the taste was actually awesome - often I pretended to like cereals because it had my favorite cartoon characters on it (looking at you Real Ghostbusters) but this cereal was fabulous. I don't care it was essentially this, or a rip-off o this, or whatever - I just remember my mouth watering thinking about having a bowl. So good!",370,,,
NoJustNo,1,"The only people who would rate this cereal highly would be those who never ate it. I begged for it and when I got it I was unpleasantly surprised. The cereal was literally a bad Chex knockoff. The cereal would nearly disintegrate when you added milk. The marshmallows were absolutely disgusting and would also go to crud when you added milk. This cereal was literally just as bad as the Ghostbusters cereal that came out 8 years or so before this one. Ralston should never have made cereal, because all the cereals they made branded for movies and cartoons were disgusting!",370,,,
The Ritty,5,This is in my top 5 all-time favorites.,370,,,
Aaron,5,Loved this stuff! I was lucky enough to purchase the original art used for the image on the front of the box! The pride of my collection!,370,,,
Steve-Os,5,"Ralston, how dare you go out of business and stop making this Ninja Turtle cereal. This was the best cereal in recent decades. I loved the green honey ooze that came with it. Years later, it was re-released as the Spiderman cereal in the early 90's. Kids today don't even know what they're missing.",370,,,
Timmerz,5,Absolutely loved this cereal. One of my all-time favorites. I had collected all the Ninja Turtle bowls that came with it as a kid. They should totally bring this back.,370,,,
bethywethy17,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Oh wow! I loved this cereal! :),370,,,
Chizz,5,I have been craving this and need it! So freaking good!,370,,,
mystyblue2,5,I want it badly... I miss this cereal. It was the very best!,370,,,
pupseal,5,"This and Circus Fun cereal were my favs. If they brought these back, I would rarely eat much else for at least a month or two. In all seriousness.",370,,,
mihicoke,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Please bring it back,my husband is driving me crazy talking about how Great it was. He is thinking if the movie is back so will the cereal! I think if someone brings it back you will make a good fortune! You can count on us for a case a week of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle cereal.",370,,,
wjjvogt,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  PLEASE BRING THIS BACK! I remember my mom buying 6 boxes at a time for my siblings and I and in a week they would all be gone! We literally cried when they took them off the shelves! :( Please bring back this GREAT cereal!,370,,,
Dav,5,Best cereal ever!!,370,,,
Rosa,5,"Please, please, please bring this back. I ate this all the time as a kid and recently when I was pregnant I wanted this sooooo bad. I need this in my life!",370,,,
Gr8elepihant,5,This was so good when the web pieces got soggy in the milk. It was like a marshmallow heaven bite.,370,,,
mjowers,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Need to start a partition to bring back this cereal. I ate this for breakfast, lunch, & dinner as a kid. I miss it so much. It would be awesome for my kids to experience this cereal. So PLEASE BRING IT BACK. Your redoing the movie so why not the cereal too.",370,,,
lynne,5,Bring it back! We love it!,370,,,
Justin,5,I loved this cereal and wish it was still made! Bring it back please!,370,,,
McGiver,5,"TMNT cereal was my favorite next to Cinnamon Toast Crunch. It basically was frosted Chex with marshmallows. Frosted Chex is also discontinued as of today but with hard work and dedication, I've made a fair duplicate. Today they sell Vanilla Chex. Buy that and a box of Lucky Charms. Pluck out marshmallows and mix them in with Vanilla Chex. - Fat Boy McGiver",370,,,
Foxy S.,5,I ate a lot of cereal as a kid and this was one of my very favorites.,370,,,
jessie,5,I WANT THIS CEREAL BACK! It was SO GOOD. I used to be obsessed with it as a child!,370,,,
ida,5,I loved this when I was little and now as a mother I want to buy it for my kids.,370,,,
Brandon-S,5,This cereal was re-released as the Spiderman cereal for a limited time when the first movie came out in 2002.,370,,,
Ninja T.C.,5,Ninja Turtle cereal! I've never seen this but I would for sure buy it if I saw it in the store. Fun!,370,,,
T.O.N.Y.,5,Can someone please duplicate or bring this cereal back? Thank you.,370,,,
Ninja Wish,5,"The Ninja Turtle cereal should have never gone out of production. In fact, the cereal itself is a great cereal, and could have made billions of dollars if would have stayed on the market! I believe that if it was put back on the market in 2013, as it was originally made, the company who made the cereal would receive a great increase in revenue, especially when it comes to the original. Smurf and Batman cereals were great, but the all time greatest is the Ninja Turtle cereal.",370,,,
shockwave,5,They should have never stopped making this cereal. It was really good!,370,,,
Munz,5,I miss this!,370,,,
Cerealkiller,4,I loved the ooze that came with the cereal. Which only happened for a limited time. I'd like to know what that was so I can try to make it.,370,,,
McFlyJr1979,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This stuff was SOOOO good but if you let it sit more than 5 minutes... as Mr. T would say after looking at his own cereal, ""I Pity the fool"". It got kind of mushy :-)",370,,,
nine99,5,"It may have been unhealthy, but it was delicious! One of my childhood favorites.",370,,,
dee,5,I miss this cereal... wish I could have a bowl now. Seeing the box made me immediately hungry.,370,,,
chuckie,0,Sorry. I didn't like the cartoon and I didn't like the cereal. It was like Lucky Charms without the charm.,370,,,
angelo,4,You're doing a great job with this site. Great to see the old TMNT cereal commercial again. I used to eat this cereal a lot.,370,,,
bigval,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Best ever... I'm 27 years old and I am online filling out a survey about cereal I used to eat when I was 7 years old... Where can I buy it now is the question??,370,,,
heidi,5,Loved this cereal. I have the bowls that came with it. Best ever to eat the cereal out of the ninja turtle bowls.,370,,,
Splinter,5,It was like Crispix meets Lucky Charms.,370,,,
CactusHeart,2,"I'll confess: I was such a TMNT groupie back when I was a kid, I loved the IDEA so much, that I actually choked down this mess thinking it was good because it had the turtles on it. And this cereal really was a mess... The flavors didn't go together at all, and once the frosted chex, er, I mean...""ninja nets"" *rolling eyes* came in contact with the milk, it turned into soggy slop(or should I say ""it mutated into""? *LOL*)and the symmetrically-challenged marshmallows turned the milk a sickly grayish blue. Also gross were those ""Hostess"" pudding pies with vanilla-flavored-phlegm filling they also sold back in the day...with a green sugar ""shell"" coating outside the crust... Yeeesh! What was I thinking liking ANY of those things? Just for a name and face on a label? *LOL*",370,,,

Krunchers #1,5,"This cereal is better than some cooked meals. If they even brought this cereal back for a limited time, I would spend $100 for a crate to surplus. Cinnamon Toast Crunch is garbage compared to Cinnamon Krunchers. There's just no question that this cereal is the greatest ever.",373,,,
Megs,5,"My brother and I were just reminiscing how great this cereal was - he's fifteen and I'm sixteen. C'mon, guys, bring it back? Please?",373,,,
Demand Them Back,5,If this cereal has a chance to be brought back it's going to take thousands of emails to Kellogg's. So we all need to get busy and do our part!,373,,,
Park1,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Kellogg's made a huge mistake in marketing this cereal to 8 to 12 year olds! I tried to tell them this but they would not listen! If they brought it back and marketed it to adults, it would be a colossal success! Who do they think is leaving these comments? Certainly not children!",373,,,
Big Daddy,5,They still serve these in small packages in school cafeterias. My daughter eats them all the time and loves them. I'm going to get a box from eBay.,373,,,
mygreybunny,5,"I thought that I was the only one that loved this cereal until I read the other reviews. This is my favorite cereal. I live in a very, very small town so I thought it was just not here anymore. Please bring this cereal back. Why did they stop making it anyway?",373,,,
Hyatt F.,5,Please bring it back. Maybe just as a one-time promo so I can stock up.,373,,,

TargetAudience,5,"Tony's Cinnamon Krunchers were not only the most amazing cinnamon based cereal of all time, but also the most delicious cereal of all time. I''m a fan of Tony's Frosted Flakes, but the deliciousness of Tony's Cinnamon Krunchers was unparalleled, as there is nothing on the face of this Earth that holds a candle to the tasty cinnamon delight of Tony's Cinnamon Krunchers. So please for the sake of all cereal kind, bring back those Cinnamon Krunchers.",373,,,
I Luv Krunchers,5,"This cereal needs to be brought back. This is the best cereal ever made, in my opinion. I don't even understand what kind of business move it was to make it a limited edition product.",373,,,

Brian B.,5,"I can't believe they don't sell it anymore. I just went to the store awhile ago and couldn't find it at all. Then, just read that they don't sell it anymore. Ugggghhh!",373,,,
Spence,5,"Whenever casual cereal conversation comes up, I'll mention this cereal and it seems like no one else appreciated it the way I did. Best cereal ever.

CKsNUMBER1FAN,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I've been telling my friends about this epic cereal and how much I miss it. I looked it up just now to see where I could buy it, to find out it isn't sold anymore. I really honestly am DEVASTATED right now! Seriously I really am! :( It was the best cereal that would ever exist. PLEASE bring it back! I'll do anything! I'll do your commercials for you for free. Just give me endless Cinnamon Krunchers for the rest of my life and I'll show it to everyone I know... ANYTHING to get it back on the shelves! PlEASE DO IT!",373,,,
whittier,5,"The best cereal around the shortest time. It was crunchy and packed with cinnamon. Was the connection to Tony The Tiger that caused it to fail? People connect him with flakes, so maybe they were expecting something different when they opened the box. Bring it back under a different branding maybe? Just bring it back!",373,,,
Jen,5,"Please... Please bring back CINNAMON KRUNCHERS! This cereal was my staple in college... I ate it breakfast, lunch and those midnight study sessions.",373,,,

britdewb,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Yeh I used to go through 5 boxes a week! This was the best cinnamon cereal ever! Cinnamon Toast Crunch is off brand compared to this stuff. I wish they'd bring it back.,373,,,
meg knight,5,I really wish there was something that we could do to bring this cereal back. It was my favorite cereal.,373,,,

supermanforever,5,"This cereal was definitely one of my top favorites, I really hope Kellogg's brings it back. I also truly agree, it was just as awesome in the box as a snack as it was in a cereal bowl with milk, and it really never got soggy.",373,,,
MrSuave,5,"I was deeply hurt when I no longer saw this cereal in stores. It is the best cereal I EVER tasted and I hope it will soon be back on the market. If not, can I get at least 1 sent to my house every month? Yes this cereal is that good!",373,,,
rmurphy3565,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I also loved this cereal. Maybe it should have been marketed as an adult product instead of TONY's. I don't care for Frosted Flakes, too sweet. By the way, Kroger offers a cereal close to Krunchers called Cinnamon Swirls. Good amt. of cinnamon, stays crunchy, and not too sweet.",373,,,
X-Woman,5,This was gone before ever got to realize how good it was. It was wonderful.,373,,,
cinnkrunch,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This really was and still is my favorite cereal. I reminisce about the good 'ol days when it was around.

This was the best cereal.",373,,,
jesse,5,This cereal is the best. I know at least 100 people who would buy this cereal a.s.a.p its the best and they should bring it back.,373,,,
capitals,5,The Best Cereal In The Entire World!! BRING IT BACK!!!!!,373,,,
MG,5,"Best cereal on the face of this earth, and why why why why would they take it away. Kellogg's would make ""alot!!!"" of money if they would bring it back.

zesty1,5,Super good. It seemed like one day this cereal was gone but the Cinnamon Krunchers breakfast bars based on it lived on for years after. I'm surprised this cereal didn't last a lot longer. It should have.,373,,,

total flake,5,Best corn flakes ever. Really miss them. Bring them back.,451,,,
A.B.,5,I miss this cereal. I hope they bring it back.,451,,,
Jaye23,5,"I still miss Total Corn Flakes. I bought them a couple of times a week. Ate them plain, in place of potato chips.",451,,,
MrMustard,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Another great cereal that some bozo executive decided to yank from the shelves. In favor of more sugary superhero or cartoon-linked cereal. Sad.,451,,,
Postman,5,Total Corn Flakes were really good. Delicious and nutritious.,451,,,
Frances M,5,No other Corn Flake can compare to Total Corn Flakes as far as taste and nutritional value. I haven't given up hope that I will someday walk into my local supermarket and find them on the shelf. PLEASE BRING THEM BACK!,451,,,
Corntotal lover,5,I loved Corn Total! Don't eat cereal since they took Corn Total off the market! Please bring it back!,451,,,
cereal guy,5,I've got a coupon for Total Corn Flakes. General Mills needs to bring it back.,451,,,
cerealguy-6,5,Can someone put a Total Corn Flakes commercial up on this page please?,451,,,
Ozzie,0,Bring it back. Best cornflakes ever made.,451,,,
Starduct,5,Best corn 'flake' ever made. Was more like a disk or chip than a flake. Never got soggy. Would love to see it return.,451,,,
Diane D.,5,"As far as taste AND nutrition go, Total Corn Flakes was my all-time favorite cereal, and I'm NOT a cereal-eater! Please bring them back! I promise I will buy them every week if you do. Thank you!",451,,,
Want My T.C.F.,5,Hi. I also miss Total Corn Flakes.,451,,,
Mary F.,5,I haven't been able to find Total Corn Flakes for a few years now. They were the BEST because they didn't get soggy like every other brand does. I've actually emailed General Mills but only received a 'Thank you for your comments' form letter in return.,451,,,
Bini,5,Total Corn Flakes was my favorite cereal. When it was discontinued I stopped eating cereal and have not eaten cereal since. It was the best. It was healthy. It didn't get soggy. Hope they bring it back!,451,,,
Buddy,5,"We loved Total Corn Flakes! It doesn't get soggy right away. Why did they stop making it? Please, oh Please, bring it back.",451,,,
#1Mom,5,Total Corn Flakes was my ultimate favorite breakfast cereal. I thought that it was only in limited markets and decided to look for it online only to sadly find out that it was discontinued. If it needs a new marketing campaign - then use me. My OB Gyn Dr. said that I don't have to take those horrible iron & vitamin supplements (you know - that constipate you) during my pregnancy if I eat the Total Corn Flakes. It tastes great and helps to make me feel like I am doing all that I can do for my babies. Please bring it back - for the health of our unborn youth!,451,,,
DL,5,"I always loved it, bring it back. Total would make lots of money if they bring it back.",451,,,
deputydog7d,5,"I wish they'd bring Total Cornflakes back... they were high in vitamins and minerals, tasted great and were super crunchy... unlike all other brands I've tried. Kellogg's Product 19 is the closest thing I've found to Total Cornflakes, but even they are getting harder to find.",451,,,
gailh,0,General Mills needs a corn based cereal that is high in calcium. Please bring it back.,451,,,
Mari,5,"Why was Total Corn Flakes discontinued? It is a fine product that provides 100% MDR of calcium. Please provide reason for this decision. By all means, PLEASE BRING IT BACK!",451,,,
dolly,5,I too love Total Corn Flakes. Please bring them back. No other corn flakes are as good. - Lorraine,451,,,
janet,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Total Corn Flakes was the best cereal, BAR NONE. It had the great taste of corn flakes (tasted a little like Product 19) with all the 100% daily vitamin values of regular Total. It was the best of both worlds!",451,,,
Luther J.,5,Total Corn Flakes was my favorite cereal. I used to buy like 6 boxes at a time. Please bring back Total Corn Flake. Why can't they bring it back! This is better then the other Total cereals. I'm still mad they don't make it anymore. Is there a black market for this cereal?,451,,,
sally6,0,I was just told to eat Total Corn Flakes for calcium! Now it's gone. Please bring it back.,451,,,
Tinna,5,I loved Total Corn Flakes! Please bring this cereal back ASAP!,451,,,
Total Corn Love,5,Total Corn Flakes was the best ever. I will never return to eating cereals. I don't eat eggs... just toast. I used to even take this cereal to work in a baggie to eat during the day. Bring back Total Corn Flakes. A lot of people can't eat wheat flakes or other dry brands.,451,,,
Kathy,5,I also search for Total Cornflakes - hoping I'll see it on the shelves again. Loved it!,451,,,
Bob41,0,This was best cereal EVER. I have not eaten any other cereal since they removed it from the market. I sincerely hope they bring it back so I can go back to eating cereal again.,451,,,
Lee43,5,I hope they bring this one back. Total Corn Flakes were better than Kellogg's Corn Flakes and better than regular Total cereal.,451,,,
Chabotjo,5,I completely agree. It's the one cereal with tons of niacin that tastes good. I need to lower my blood pressure. That will work for me - if GM brings it back.,451,,,
bubba,5,Total Corn Flakes was the best cereal there was. Why can't they bring it back! Their idea of good cereal has to be idiotic because of taking Total Corn Flakes off the market. - Diane,451,,,
Beth,5,"Please, General Mills... bring your Total Corn Flakes back... my mom and I just love this cereal.",451,,,
Birdie,4,Please bring back Corn Total. They would probably have less gluten than wheat.,451,,,
Mak,5,Could you please bring back the original Total Corn Flakes in the yellow box. They were the best. The texture and the crunch were perfect. I miss this breakfast cereal!,451,,,
Ruti,5,Best cereal ever. I watch the shelves every time I visit the store to see if it's back.,451,,,
cerealqueen,5,"Total corn flakes were my absolute favorite. I wish the company would bring them back, especially if so many people loved that type and the want for that particular cereal is in high demand!",451,,,
brisco,5,Bring them back!!!!,451,,,
Alswed,5,"Bring them back, please.",451,,,
telecaster,5,"Are these really gone? They weren't just the best corn flakes, they were the best of the Total cereals too. I also like Country Corn Flakes from General Mills, but I haven't seen them in a while either. Where are all my favorite cereals going? Up to heaven waiting for me, if there's a God.",451,,,
GodFirst,5,My Dad and I would get up at 6am every morning before I went to school and we would have Total corn flakes for breakfast and a banana... so please bring them back... I would love to share that moment with my 3 children.,451,,,
buck,5,Bring back my Total Corn Flakes pleezeeee!,451,,,
beth4prez,5,Total corn flakes were the best corn flakes ever. I've been missing then for years.,451,,,
Hec,5,"If it tasted great, sold a lot, why not sell it? I miss that cereal.",451,,,
Stog,5,"Agreed! Total Corn Flakes were the best corn flakes cereal BY FAR! We miss them, wish Total would bring them back",451,,,
chip chop,5,That sucks. I really loved Total Corn Flakes too. I was hoping. Too bad.,451,,,
Sagan,5,I love Total in the yellow box only... that's what I call it...,451,,,
Sue,5,I love Total corn flakes and since I no longer can buy them in the area stores I assume they are no longer available. They were the best corn flakes! Why discontinue a good thing?,451,,,
spongey,5,Unfortunately Total Corn Flakes was discontinued a while back when Total refreshed their line up with those awful lightly sweetened cereals fads of late. These along with Product 19 and Team Flakes were my three favorite cereals... I say were because it appears Product 19 is no longer being stocked in my area any longer.,451,,,
richgrec,5,I love Total Corn flakes without all the sweet crap like fruits etc. that seems to be all that you can buy now days. Do they still make the good stuff in the yellow box?,451,,,

bowana,5,Please bring this back. It's my all-time favorite cereal!,377,,,

Buzzy,5,I can't find Total Raisin Bran in any store nor anywhere on the internet. We've tried all the other brands but none are as good as Total.,377,,,
Flanders,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Best Raisin Bran. The flakes stay crisp and the raisins are moist. All other Raisin Brans I've tried, the flakes quickly become mush and their raisins are hard.",377,,,
The Big O,5,When will this be back on the market. Best cereal I've eaten in my 67 years.,377,,,
Ratzo,5,I hate that this is not being made anymore. It was one good thing I knew I was eating. Please bring it back!,377,,,
flakie,5,Best cereal ever. No soggy flakes!,377,,,

C. Love7,5,Lots of vitamins and does not get soggy in milk! Please bring it back!,377,,,
Bee Jay,5,I've search stores and the internet and can't find my Total Raisin Bran. It was my favorite. Way better than regular Kellogg's Raisin Bran. I NEED IT back!,377,,,
Puzzled,5,"Oh, my Goodness, this is not one of the best cereals, but The BEST Cereal on this planet. Is it because it's too healthy? Overwhelmed with this loss. Praying that it returns.",377,,,
capt cole,5,Bring it back with less carbs for diabetics. Thanks.,377,,,
Beeve,5,"I'm in shock. Reading the comments here and everyone loves Total Raisin Bran. Especially me! I keep checking the store for it every time I go. If this is gone forever, I'm probably done with cereal for good.",377,,,
Gram,5,Please bring it back. I love it!,377,,,
Sad Mary,0,"Please, please bring it back! My daily go-to cereal is gone, gone? Can't believe it. Why?",377,,,
Don7,5,When is it coming back to stores? I'm ready and waiting.,377,,,
Missing YOU,5,"General Mills seems like a drug dealer. They get you hooked, then withhold the product. Soon you'll see it back at a higher price for less volume. Shame on General Mills. I hope I'm wrong.",377,,,
J.G.,5,Why do they discontinue Total Raisin Bran which it the best and leave all the other garbage to continue to be sold?,377,,,
Big John,5,I can NOT believe they discontinued my favorite,377,,,
Smurf,5,"I, too, want to know what has happened to this cereal, which has disappeared from store shelves. It is fortified with so much more of the vitamins and nutrients needed in our diets than other brands of raisin bran, which is why it has been my choice for a long time.",377,,,
gram,5,I want my Total Raisin Bran Cereal back!,377,,,
dijode,5,"Has been the start to my day for 30 years... is it gone forever, or just lost somewhere?!",377,,,

charlie-12,5,It appears that I am not the only person in search of Total Raisin Bran. It is by far the best Raisin Bran out there. Hopefully it will be available again soon.,377,,,
Pudding,5,"From all I've seen, it appears that Total Raisin Bran was a very popular cereal, so why are they no longer making it. I have found no other cereal on the market that comes close to what it had for nutrition.",377,,,
mike-56,5,Best cereal I have ever eaten. I love it. Nothing else compares.,377,,,
Barney,0,Don't expect any response from General Mills. I wrote to them asking to fix the packaging because the inner bag is next to impossible to open. They replied that 'it was saving the environment with less packaging.' That was a bold faced lie. General Mills is not a very reliable company. They claim that Total Raisin Bran is still available. I can't find it.,377,,,
Vickie,5,I can't find it anywhere. Is it discontinued? I really need it for my calcium intake since I cannot tolerate pills.,377,,,

LoveMyCereal,5,I have eaten Total Raisin Bran since it came on the market. I even carry it in zip loc bags when I travel as a healthy start to the day. Now it has disappeared. What is going on? There is simply nothing else like it - not regular Total or other brands of raisin bran.,377,,,
Daphne,4,A supermarket employee told me they are re-designing the box and making it 1.5 ounces lighter so its been sold out for like 6 weeks. Only stuff my husband likes.,377,,,
Marathon Runner,5,Bring it back. I buy 10 at a time. Clerks use to ask me if there was a problem at our house. Only cereal husband will eat. Please don't make me cook breakfast.,377,,,
John O.,0,"Live in Saddle River, NJ. Having trouble finding Total Raisin Bran in any of our local supermarkets. Seems to be a new problem. Have been eating it for years.",377,,,
Phyllis,5,"We went to Pointe Verde, Florida over Thanksgiving and bought two boxes. I wish I had bought all of it!",377,,,
Leelee,5,I haven't been able to find Total Raisin Bran cereal at all either for more than a month now. I'm so disappointed! I have had to purchase it on Amazon which is very costly. I wish General Mills would have let us loyal consumers know that it is now discontinued!,377,,,
Missing TRB,5,Does anyone know why Total Raisin Bran is no longer being sold in supermarkets? I haven't been able to find it for more than a month now.,377,,,
Donna6,5,I have looked in every store I go to for Total Raisin Bran and nobody has it anymore! Please put it back in the stores!,377,,,
lucy,5,My husband is devoted to this cereal - but I can not find it - or enen regular Total - it is out of stock at Walmart online. If I go to the store - IF they have it - and I mean regular Total - it is on the top shelf and I have to knock it off the shelf with a broom.,377,,,

jsquared56,5,Was my favorite cereal as a kid. Seemed like it wasn't around very long.,895,,,
paperfolder,5,"I remember Triple Snack as a kid and it was GREAT! I was really disappointed when Kellogg's stopped making it. The commercials for it on YouTube feature a kid in a pith helmet singing to a giraffe, which I never saw. The commercial I DO remember seeing featured the giraffe singing. His song began, ""I'm sticking my neck out for new Kellogg's Triple Snack..."" That version of the commercial seems to be lost. Like Triple Snack itself, I sure do wish I could experience that commercial again!",895,,,
AuggieWren,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) I remember an elephant being pictured on box (makes sense, no?) and the cereal itself having only peanuts and Sugar-Crisp-like puffed rice.",895,,,
Elizabeth S.,5,Can it be found anywhere anymore? I have fading memories of it being wonderful.,895,,,
Baby Boom,4,I can verify from my razor-sharp childhood memory that Boo Boo Bear was indeed pictured for a time on Triple Snack boxes.,895,,,
Megifer,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I ONLY remember Boo-Boo Bear being on the box and only ever seeing this in the single-serve box collections. Loved this cereal!,895,,,
Sweet Memory,5,"I have always remembered that as a small child my favorite cereal had a giraffe on the box and had peanuts in it, but then they stopped making it. I've thought about it over the years, wondering if I would ever be able to find out what it was. I just googled it and found it! This is so surreal! It was discontinued in 1965 when I was 6 years old, but I never forgot how much I loved that cereal with the peanuts in it!",895,,,
Mgrape,5,The best cereal ever.,895,,,
chalenn,5,AWESOME. I remember eating this as a kid.,895,,,
snodgrass,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Great right out of the box or amazing with milk. I'm going to get hold of some peanuts, Corn Pops and Honey Snacks and try mixing my own for breakfast this weekend.",895,,,
PeeBee,5,"Fond, Fond memories. I too thought it was just a dream. Right out of the box!",895,,,
VA Peanuts?,5,"Loved it as a kid and no one remembered what it was. I thought they were Spanish peanuts, not Virginia peanuts, was I right?",895,,,
RickLincroft,5,"I so loved Triple Snack when I was a youngster. And yes, I too used to eat it dry, right out of the box. I can even recall filling Baggies with the stuff, as a sort of ""trail mix"", when my friends and I used to explore the nearby woods. Sadly, my little sister favored Cocoa Puffs and Cap'n Crunch, both of which I hated, while little sis hated Triple Snack because she didn't like the peanuts. Consequently, Triple Snack was a rare commodity in our house. (I 'always' knew she was your favorite, Mom!) Emotional scares aside... Now with every kid seemingly allergic to peanuts, and peanuts being declared deadly choking hazards, there's little likelihood of them ever bringing it back. It's gone to join Mister Salty Pretzel Sticks, and Hoffman Sodas, in the realm of fondly remembered foods from days gone by.",895,,,
DSS,5,The best. I've been searching forever. Thought I dreamed it. Born in 1955.,895,,,
Twimfina,5,"I fondly remember discovering this during breakfast one summer at Camp Don Bosco near St. Louis. It came in one of those small, single-serve perforated boxes (that could be opened and used as a bowl for milk - at least in theory). I've been looking for it ever since! Thank you!",895,,,
My Old Favorite,5,"I loved this cereal and remember it with such fond memories. How I wish it was still in production. In fact, I googled ""Triple Snack"". I thought that, perhaps, I had only imagined it!",895,,,
kbmusic,5,Loved this cereal! I also remember it as Triple Treat - at least that's what was called it as kids.,895,,,
lala,0,AWESOME! My little brother put a peanut up his nose one Saturday morning watching cartoons. Cool to see this!,895,,,
white owl,4,I remember a commercial where the giraffe sang 'as far as I can see / and I can see to there and back / Triple Snack is right for me / and I am right for Triple Snack.',895,,,
Avrige Bear,4,"Here's how to bring it back yourself. It's easy! Just take some UNSALTED peanuts, some CORN POPS cereal and some HONEY SMACKS cereal. Mix it all together. That's all there is to it!",895,,,
wazzoo,0,"Summer camp 1963 - Camp Mary Orton in Delaware, Ohio: Eating Triple Snack, which I thought I remembered as Triple Treat, peanuts corn pops etc., I loved it. I remember.",895,,,
misscolleen,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was my favorite cereal as a kid... was so sad when it was discontinued. Glad to find this page... Whenever I asked anyone if they remembered a cereal with peanuts in it, they looked at me like I was crazy! Was starting to think maybe I was! Just might whip up a homemade batch to see what the grandkids think of it!",895,,,
Thomas,5,"I remember, as a toddler, sitting in my footy pajamas on the kitchen floor in front of the heat register, eating the peanuts out of the big box of Triple Treat. As I recall, I was not even old enough to speak! For years, I wondered if my memory was something that happened in reality, or if it was just a childhood dream. Years later, I discovered that it WAS a real cereal and that my memory was based in reality after all!",895,,,
Found U.,5,"I was born in 1959, and I, too, remember this cereal being offered in the variety package. I remembered the giraffe and of course the peanuts, but I did not know the name. I've been searching for the name for years. THANKS!",895,,,
bthomp,5,"My favorite cereal when I was growing up... ""Triple Snack will get you - if you don't (I won't) watch out."" Yum! Thanks for bringing back the memories.",895,,,
Palma,0,My brother and I have been trying to remember this jingle for years and what it was for - finally found this website and then the jingle on YouYube. Never tried the cereal but love the ad!,895,,,
B. Au Lait,5,I also remember this cereal from when I was young. It was in the snack pack. I think it was a treat to have it as my parents didn't allow sugar stuff. I will always think of my child years when I see this site. Missing those times so long ago.,895,,,
darryl1,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Oh my gawd, I remember this cereal as a kid. I am 57 now and glad I found this site. This site brings back a lot of memories on the old cereals we had as kids.",895,,,
Texas CLM,0,"The jingle, as I remember it, went like this: ""If you (and I do) like peanuts / Then you'll (and I do) like Triple Snack / Triple Snack will get ya / If you don't (and I won't) watch out!""",895,,,
valjean1426,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I'm happy to have found this site, also! When I try to tell friends about Triple Snack they think I'm crazy. Wait until they see THIS!!!:)",895,,,
Johnno,5,"I remember having this cereal in the infamous Kel-Bowl-Pac at camp in Vermont. I loved it! I never saw the large boxes in the supermarket in NYC, I vaguely remember it being available in a variety pack of single servings. Ironically, Kellogg's has a listing on its website for you to make your own, using 1 cup of each (Sugar Smacks has been replaced by ""Honey Crunch"")",895,,,
Bennie,4,"I was born in 1959 and this was my favorite cereal. Just remembered that it had peanuts and a giraffe on the box. It would come in the single serve variety packs. I was trying to explain what it was to my family and glad I found this site. May buy some current day Corn Pops and Honey Smacks, add some roasted peanuts and see if its good as I thought, just for kicks.",895,,,
Stanwick,5,I am 56 and I loved this cereal as well! With all the peanut allergies today I doubt they would bring it back. Easy enough to duplicate!,895,,,
debbystang,5,This cereal was fantastic! I still remember it after all these years and I'm in my 50's. Wish they would bring it back.,895,,,
Molly,5,They shouldn't have taken this cereal away! It's still,895,,,
lost in the 60s,5,Fantastic cereal. I really wish it was still available.,895,,,
nik nak snack,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My oldest sister and I both remember and loved this cereal, I too wish they would bring it back. I think the little jingle went something like this... If you don't like peanuts, watch out for Triple Snack, Triple Snack will get you, if you don't watch out. Does any one out there know for sure?",895,,,
kingpin,5,"This cereal was fantastic! Not many remember it, but I wish they would bring it back!",895,,,
Nut-nut,5,I loved this cereal especially the peanuts.,895,,,
Annie,5,"Why was it ever discontinued? I still think about it, and I am in my fifties! Loved it before school.",895,,,
Grzesiak,5,Have you found the ad with the jingle for Triple Snack? I ate it as a kid and still remember the song but my kids think I'm making it up. I'd love to show them the ad.,895,,,
Bird,0,"""If you don't like peanuts, watch out for Triple Snack... Triple Snack will get you, If you don't watch out!!"" There was also a counterpoint melody and lyric ""If you don't (I do)... like peanuts...""",895,,,
ageless kid,0,"First, I thought that Triple Snack was just only a part of Snack Pack, Variety Pack and Jumbo Assortment until it started hitting the shelves in full-size boxes. Weird, wasn't it.",895,,,
Coach,5,"I really liked Triple Snack cereal. Can anybody remember all the lyrics from the commercials? I just remember parts, like: Triple Snack is right for me and I am right for Triple Snack!",895,,,
kadon,5,It was my favorite cereal... as long as it lasted.,895,,,
royhobbs7,5,"It is still my favorite cereal. I make it by adding all of the former ingredients (i.e., sugar corn pops, sugar smacks + peanuts). The only difference is that I use honey roasted peanuts these days. It is still the best cereal (in my judgment of taste) ever made. Try it with honey roasted peanuts (adds some additional honey nut sweetness).",895,,,
psbcap,5,Me too! (re. I loved Triple Snack cereal),895,,,
leonard,0,I loved this cereal especially the nuts. I glad to see I'm not alone.,895,,,
Bummed in San J,5,"I'm nearly 50 and I still have fond memories of this cereal's unique and satisfying taste, which was discontinued when I was 4 years old... I still remember the tantrum I threw when I found out...",895,,,
C.C.,5,Four decades later and I'm still whizzzed at Kellogg's for making the best cereal ever... disappear.,895,,,
sharoo,5,I loved this cereal!!! I even remembered the song that went with it!!!!,895,,,
Vespa,5,It was very unique.,895,,,
Dianne,5,My nephew and I used to eat this back in the 1967 when I was expecting my oldest son.,895,,,
coloradojulie,5,"I LOVED this cereal when it came out! I guess it was short lived though. Of course I never at it with milk! It was meant to be eaten dry as a snack, I think. Hence the name!",895,,,
snooky,5,I absolutely loved this cereal and was very disappointed when it was discontinued.,895,,,

JustSomeGuy,2,"My cousin was part of the team that created Triples; we got sent a box at some point in the development process - it was probably after it was already test marketing in some part of the country, as it looked like a finished product. I remember, as a pre-teen or early teenager, telling my mom ""this tastes like stale rice krispies,"" and that first version was definitely aimed at grownups (""yuppie-chow."") By the time the product was available in NY on retail shelves, they'd added some more sugar, and it tasted OK.",378,,,
Cereal guy,5,I bet General Mills could bring back Triples sooner or later.,378,,,
cereal guy,5,"Since General Mills brought back French Toast Crunch, maybe General Mills will bring back Clusters, Triples, Wheaties Honey Gold, original Oatmeal Crisp, Oatmeal Raisin Crisp & Multi Bran Chex for a whole new generation of cereal lovers and fans.",378,,,

Fran,0,Found a recipe from the Triples cereal box GM used to make... Peanut Butter-Chocolate squares. This was a favorite with my son. I was wondering what cereal would be the best to make it with today since GM doesn't make Triples today.,378,,,
dollartreeyum,5,"This was my favorite cereal growing up. I remembered it when I just bought a box of 'Crispy Rice' by 'American Breakfast' from Dollar Tree. It has the same level of sweetness and same texture, but it doesn't have the other two grains. I'd love it if someone would make Triples again.",378,,,
Chris5204,5,"Triples was great until they 'improved' it. Before General Mills stopped making it, they kind of ruined it by making it more air puffed. It wasn't as crispy as it had been and I stopped eating it.",378,,,

SeXxXidEVIL,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I tried Honey Kix for the first time and the taste reminded me of this. I had only a vague memory from my childhood of a teal box and tri-colored cereal. Thanks to Google, I was able to put a name to this delicious cereal from a long forgotten memory! I am searching high and low with no luck so if anyone has come across it please post for those of us also craving another taste! Until then, we'll just have to write GM to start production again! However for those of you looking for something in the meantime, GM Honey Kix are a very close match to the taste of Triples - enough so that trying them triggered the memory of these. And I had to have been like 5 the last time I had them! That being said, they must taste extremely similar because until now I hadn't a thought or care about them!",378,,,

Ginger,4,I have been searching tediously for this cereal to use in a recipe contest! Please bring it back soon! Why did General Mills or Kelloggs discontinue it? Maria,378,,,
Dave,5,I absolutely loved this cereal and ate it all the time. It had a delicious hint of brown sugar mixed with rice and corn. Far superior to Rice Krispies and the puffs stayed crunchy and didn't get soggy. I was dismayed when I could no longer find it at any store and have missed it ever since. Please General Mills bring back Triples.,378,,,
Lothiel,5,"This cereal was delicious! I wish it was still around, I remember absolutely loving it!",378,,,
AmberLea,5,Bring it back please! =(,378,,,
Kitty,3,"This was actually a very good cereal. The only problem taste wise was one type had a slightly odd taste and the other an even order. Each type brought a different taste. When the three combined it came out a little sweet, a little buttery, and a little bit of that heard to describe nut taste you get from things like Grape-Nuts. The cereal was some how not very suseptible to sogginess. The pieces were a little larger then Rice Krispies, just enough you could snatch a little and eat it dry but not very well ( just not the perfect shape for that). Mostly the negatives were the advertisement. This obviously was not Rice Krispies, it was something different and they should have been proud of it. There was nothing all that appealing in ads to make any target interested at all. Not even a good enough "" This is healthy and it's not sugar coated"". It obviously didn't have a Mascot or anything to draw in kids, but it was good enough that if a child took a bite ( dry or in milk) they would containue eatting on their own. I'm going to give this a 3 because the ads were just that damageing. Something was a little off in the taste that would need to be addressed as well (probably from the baking process). If they bring this back, I would recommend you give it a try.",378,,,
becks,5,This was one of my most favorite childhood memories. Going to New York and sitting down with my grandma with a bowl of Triples. They need to bring this back!,378,,,

I was surprised at how well it flew.",379,,,

dmadd12,5,I wish this cereal would come back sooo bad!,133,,,
Adam Selzer,5,Aldi has a peanut butter chocolate Cheerios knock off that tastes exactly the way I remember E.T. Cereal tasting. Even after 30+ years it's uncanny!,133,,,
Buckhorn,0,Very cool. Never knew it existed. Would have liked to try it. Sounds tasty.,133,,,
Warlocke,3,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Back when it came out, it was the only chocolate and peanut butter cereal I'd encountered, and I don't remember another one until many years later. I wasn't exactly the biggest fan of movie E.T., despite my mother deciding I needed the bedspread with matching curtains... but the cereal tasted better than I had expected of the ugly little guy on the box.",133,,,
SpaceBarron,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  The best chocolate cereal. The best peanut butter cereal. A recipe from the Cereal Gods!,133,,,
Mike-31,5,"I wrote a letter to General Mills when I couldn't find it on the store shelves but I haven't heard back from them. I think the E.T. Cereal was great. Maybe if there is a remake of the E.T. movie, they'll bring it back.",133,,,
spami,3,(Team Breakfast Member)  It was sure better than the E.T. game we had.,133,,,
Jamie Lynn,5,BEST evah! Sissy loves it!,133,,,
nuni140,0,(Team Breakfast Member) Please bring it back.. same taste please... omg please.,133,,,
Joey B,5,I have to agree with most comments. It's really the best tasting cereal I've ever had. It was similar to Reese's but slightly more peanuty and not as sweet. A perfect blend. I wish the companies would be smart enough to bring back the same taste.,133,,,
Marymary,5,"I still dream of this cereal. In a very sad attempt to recreate it I used to mix Count Chocula with peanut butter Cap'n Crunch. It's not even close. Reese's is ok, but not nearly as good. How fun would it be of they brought it back a retro cereal each month for a year? I'm sure the sales would be through the roof!",133,,,
Bucksky11,3,"I remember having the Michael Jackson story album as a kid. As for the cereal, I remember it tasting a little funky too me. I could eat it but it wasn't my favorite.",133,,,
Kim11,5,This was the best peanut butter tasting cereal EVER! Please bring this back with the original ingredients. What I would do just for a bowl of this!,133,,,
Dmadd12,5,"I swear I have bought every chocolate and peanut butter mix flavored cereal looking for that taste. Please bring back this cereal even if but for a limited time. I would pay anything. Please keep the recipe the same - no changes, because I have noticed that some of my childhood cereals taste a little different now. I assumed that just like other big businesses, cereal manufacturers starting using cheaper material, or ingredients to make their product.",133,,,
Anita,5,Please bring the ET cereal back... It was the greatest cereal ever :),133,,,
Marianna,5,"I have been searching high and low for the equivalent to this cereal. Resse's Puffs comes kinda close, but not exactly... can someone grow a heart and bring back this delightful cereal. I've missed it terribly. Thank you!",133,,,
Bobby20,5,Was my favorite cereal growing up at the time. Probably my favorite all-time.,133,,,
etcereal,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  The best cereal ever... better tasting than the current Reese's Puffs. General Mills - please bring back this cereal and use the recipe for the exact flavors. Don't change a thing... it was perfection. - Lisa K.,133,,,
Maxx Retro,5,"E.T. call home! Seriously, call my house and tell me you're making your cereal again. I loved the peanut butter flavor. Come on, cereal companies... if you made these retro cereals come back for a short time, that would be big news and respectable sales!",133,,,
shockwave,5,"I vaguely remember this as a kid, but I do remember it being a little like Reeses cereal but better.",133,,,
Tanya Miller,0,"How crazy and unexpected it would be if they brought this back for a limited time. Don't you think people would buy it just because it was weird and retro? And if they keep the recipe the same as it was, it would taste good too. Do it!",133,,,
Spictorious,5,"Why did they discontinue this cereal in the first place? While I get how folks believe Reese's Puffs are as close as it gets, it is still FAR FROM the superior taste of ET cereal. The key is that ET cereal was made with oats... Reeses Puffs, with corn.",133,,,
jose,5,It was the first peanut butter cereal I can remember eating. I sure miss it after all these years.,133,,,
T-Man,5,"I wish they would bring this cereal back. It was the best, like no other.",133,,,
Roody Poo 1975,5,If you liked this cereal... go buy some Reese Peanut Butter Puffs Cereal!! They are about as close as they will ever come to the ET cereal! I buy them all the time now... and I am 37 years old! LOL,133,,,
Ken,5,"I actually have this E.T. Cereal box with the cereal *UNOPENED* Seriously! If anybody knows the value of this, I may consider selling it... Thanks! (dodong27@hotmail.com)",133,,,
A.A.T.,4,I really enjoyed this cereal when it was available.,133,,,
P. Darling,5,This was the best cereal ever made. Period. These kids today don't know anything about how good use to taste. I use to eat this every day all day. I so wish they would bring this back. Oh the memories.,133,,,
80s kid,5,"I too remember eating E.T cereal & it was, & still is, the best tasting cereal ever made. I tried the Reese's Puffs thing & it just wasn't the same. They should bring it back I bet that if they did, sales of the cereal alone would boost the economy. I can see the commercials now: ""back by popular demand E.T cereal... The ultimate stimulus package"".",133,,,
Tanner,4,I remember it tasting pretty good. I wish I would have sent away for that Michael Jackson record - It's probably valuable now.,133,,,
Kassidy,5,I have a clear memory of eating E.T. and watching cartoons when I was 10 years old. I'm wondering if the box is worth anything. It seems really rare. (Not that I kept mine... I wish!),133,,,
big ed,0,Please bring it back.,133,,,
Jason Rusk,5,"I still can almost taste your deliciousness all these years later, why does everything have to change!!!? Take me back to the 80's when the government seemed good to me, I didn't have any cares and mom always brought home my favorite ET cereal with ice cold milk!",133,,,
Jodie,5,Hi my name is Jodie and I am 12 I would really like to try this cereal so please put it back on the market.,133,,,
sumkinda,5,Please put this cereal back on the market. I enjoyed this cereal very much as a child and crave it as an adult. Children today are missing out on one of the best taste the human taste buds could ever experience. If you want to make money brown crunchy gold is the way the truth and the light. pleases!,133,,,
Felicia1,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Delicious,the best cereal General Mills ever created! It may have been 27 years ago, but I will never forget the taste!",133,,,
Grynder,0,"I am doing some research on the Michael Jackson / ET promo that General Mills had in 1984. Would like to hear from people who recieved the promo and exactly what was included in their package. thanks, Boe3000@cox.net",133,,,
Jinky,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I agree with everyone here. This cereal was out of this world and way better than Reese's Peanut Butter Puffs. I remember how much I loved the powdery chocolate substance on the peanut butter pieces. Man was this ever good!,133,,,
JCott,5,I loved this cereal as a kid. It was my favorite and Reeses puffs can never replace it! Please put this cereal back into production ! I agree with Kent and McEwin - put me down for 100 boxes.,133,,,
chimpy,0,Uggghh! I saved a box of E.T. for 10 years and then it got water damaged when we were moving. Please tell me it's not worth a lot of money now. Uggghh! Errrgghh!,133,,,
elenap5,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I liked the movie of E.T and also the cereal and the storybook & record and the free poster that came with it and the taste was awesome believe me I love chocolate and peanut butter. By Nan Twilegar.,133,,,
c-loc,5,"They tasted nothing like Reeses Puffs, they had a much more sweeter flavor, they would turn to glue if you left them in the bowl to long, lol.",133,,,
kent smally,5,I agree with Suzy. It was way better than Reeses Puffs. What a trip it would be if they brought it back for a while. Put me down for 50 boxes.,133,,,
McEwan,5,Bring this cereal back now! I will personally buy 100 boxes to help sales. E.T. phone me.,133,,,
I. M. Suzy,5,My favorite cereal!! Reeses Puffs are NOT the same! Bring this cereal back!,133,,,
T.K.,5,Cool! Bring this cereal back !!,133,,,
commodore,5,"This is one of the best cereals I ever had as a kid, and I wonder why they cant make it again.",133,,,
Trey75,5,Please oh please!! Bring this cereal back!! It's still the king of all cereal... king of kings!!,133,,,

KKnows,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Simply the best tasting cereal ever made. Why post didn't market this cereal properly is a mystery. Post would make a bundle renaming the product and marketing the original recipe intact, and they would have a winner!",1167,,,
rlh,5,I don't understand why they don't bring this back... it was so good!,1167,,,
RussPerryJr,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) One of my favorite cereals ever was Toasted Oat Flakes, which I can't seem to find any evidence of. I seem to recall that it was by Post, so I'm wondering if they renamed it, or if I'm suffering some Mandela Effect. Anyone know for sure? What made the cereal so memorable to me is that when it was dry, it was as boring as Wheaties, but if you let it get soggy, it became amazing, so I'd pour the milk on and stir for a couple minutes before eating a spoonful.",1167,,,
Laudes,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Fortified Oat Flakes is my all-time favorite cereal! Oddly, it turned out to be my husband's all-time favorite as well, and we both loved Rice Krinkles when we were really young kids. I'm not sure, but I think that for a short time they once had two other versions - one with ""freeze-dried"" strawberries, & one with some other dried berry or fruit. Can anyone confirm or deny that? (I might be conflating some other cereal with Fortified Oat Flakes...). As another reviewer pointed out, there really WAS an addictive quality to Fortified Oat Flakes. I preferred FOF to sugary cereals too, and while I always left a fair amount of those in the bottom of my bowl, I scraped out every last bit when eating FOF! I bet people would love them today, with all the interest in oats & oat milk. Besides - though I cant describe the flavor, they really were DELICIOUS!",1167,,,
LonesomeRhoades,5,BRING... IT... BACK!,1167,,,
Biff,5,This cereal had the perfect blend of flavor! I would buy it in a heartbeat if it ever came back!,1167,,,
sound_effects,5,"Definitely my all-time favorite cereal. After years of mourning, I was thrilled to see it again on the shelf around 1989-1990. I thought I was set for life from here on out. To boot, the store even had a generic brand which was pretty dang close -- close enough that if the real thing hadn't been available, I'd still have been pretty happy. I bought a few off the shelf, but didn't buy the whole shelf because I had no idea that that was the last time I'd see it. So... back to mourning.",1167,,,
lae155,5,I loved this cereal. Can't find anything that compares!,1167,,,
P.M.,5,"I loved, loved, loved this cereal! I've been looking for something similar without any luck whatsoever. Please, please bring it back! With oats being touted as a heart-healthy grain it's sure to be a hit again. Bring them back!",1167,,,

Unixtrix,5,"I loved this Cereal. Please Post, BRING IT BACK!",1167,,,
Smokey,5,"A friend of mine described these as the crack cocaine of cereal. He said he would sit down with a box and an hour later, with a little milk dribbling down his chin, the box would be empty. I have to agree. This cereal was amazing.",1167,,,
Psycho Mike,5,Been looking for something similar for 50 years... nothing comes close. Bring them back!,1167,,,
ihatepost,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was the ONLY cereal ever I will ever love. No other cereal could ever have such a special place in my heart. When I was a kid I would eat this cereal over all the sugary kids cereals VOLUNTARILY! Now my heart is broken and my life will never be the same. Post, you are cruel and heartless. My life is incomplete because of you. Have some compassion. You have no feelings and no shame.",1167,,,

Sue K,5,Best cereal I've ever eaten. Bring them back. Nothing on the market comes close to this cereal.,1167,,,
NYJohn,5,Best. Cereal. Ever.,1167,,,
Sleepy,5,I ate this cereal throughout the 60's and 70's. It was healthy and delicious. It would be an especially significant breakfast cereal in these days of heart health concerns.,1167,,,
Mary,5,"It was the best, why in the world did it get discontinued? PLEASE BRING IT BACK!",1167,,,
Kestrel,5,"Loved this so much!! When I was little, on Saturdays I'd sit with my dad in the TV room and eat Oat Flakes, best part of my week! Loved them so much, tasty and not horribly sweet like many cereals now. I WOULD EAT THESE OAT FLAKES ALL THE TIME! Please please bring them back, made just the way they were back then.",1167,,,
Steve1960,5,"I remember the very first time I ate Fortified Oat Flakes, when my late Father brought home a box for the very first time, sometime around Christmas of 1970 (I was 10). He bought the box for himself, allowing me to try a bowl. Much to his surprise (and chagrin), I wound up eating the entire box over the next couple of morning breakfasts!! It was the best tasting cereal I ever ate, PERIOD!! I loved it better than Trix, Lucky Charms, Frosted Flakes, or any other of the typical kid's cereals of the day. Nobody (even the Quaker Oats Company) is capable of making a cereal of so-called ""Oat Flakes"" that even comes close in flavor to what Post's tasted like. All ""oat flake"" cereals taste to me like Wheaties, or Total, that had been kept in an oatmeal box for about a month (and yes, I love Wheaties, and all wheat bran cereals). Please, Post Cereal Company, if you can read this, bring back this classic for all of us ""classic folk"" to enjoy, while hopefully making some new fans of it as well!!!!",1167,,,
Cindy,4,Loved this cereal growing up. Why did they ever stop making it. Hope they bring this cereal back into production.,1167,,,

OatFlakesLover,5,PLEASE start making this cereal again!,1167,,,
Kat,5,This would be a dream come true if Post would bring this cereal back. Great flavor and great memories of my brother. We ate this a lot. I would buy it if you made it POST!,1167,,,
KaraBoo,5,"I loved this cereal. I was often on my own for breakfast and lunch as a child (these days my mom would have been arrested for letting an 11 year old stay at home alone from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.!), and I would eat this for both meals - and sometimes as a snack, mid-afternoon or even before bed. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat, I really miss it. I don't eat any cereal these days, but I'd go for Fortified Oat Flakes!",1167,,,
Walt,5,I remember Post Fortified Oat Flakes as a really enjoyable cereal and I look for it on the shelf in case they started making it again. I'd buy it if Post made it.,1167,,,
Make More!,5,"This was the one cereal I ate as a child in the sixties and seventies. My family would go through boxes of it. Absolutely delicious! If Post still has the recipe, they should begin making it again. I know that I'd buy it!",1167,,,
Oat Fan,5,"I used to have a bowl of this cereal on the weekends with my grandfather. I loved how it made the milk in my cereal a creamy oat flavor. It was so, so good? Please bring it back. It's sure to be a top seller especially since people seem to be a lot more health conscious now. It's by far the best cereal I have ever had.",1167,,,
Ozark Mary,5,My all time favorite cereal. I wonder why it was discontinued?,1167,,,
ladydi,5,I loved this cereal as a child! I have missed it so much. I would love it if they brought it back. PLEASE!,1167,,,
Oaties,5,"Like everyone else said, you can not find any cereal tasting close to this one. I sure miss it. It was my favorite of all times!",1167,,,

cramby,5,My all-time favorite cereal. Absolutely nothing compares to replace it.,1167,,,
Oathappy,5,Please bring back these Oat Flakes. I keep trying other oat cereals and nothing comes close.,1167,,,
ging,5,Bring back Fortified Oat Flakes! They were delicious!,1167,,,
Betty Lou,5,"I don't like hot cereals, but I wanted a breakfast with oats and always loved Fortified Oat Flakes! I know that it was made before the 1970's because I was still living at home when I used to eat boxes of them. I really miss it!",1167,,,
Raised on Post,0,Update to my comments a few months ago about Special K Protein Original. Kellogg's has changed the recipe and it no longer brings back that Oat Flakes memory. It became so much worse in my opinion I won't buy it again.,1167,,,

Dee,5,Miss this cereal so much! I wish they would bring it back!,1167,,,
P.K.,5,"Keep hoping they will bring this cereal back. Just today I scanned the cereals and lamented that Post has not seen fit to bring back their oat flakes. By far my favorite. Like someone else commented, I seldom buy cereal anymore. I check periodically. This cereal gets nothing but favorable comments. Please bring Fortified Oats back.",1167,,,
Don,5,This was NOT introduced in 1970. I have baseball cards that I cut from Fortified boxes in 1961-62. Best ever. I got my oldest son addicted to it in the '70's.,1167,,,
Nan,5,"This was the only cereal I would pick out at the grocery store, and I ate it until they stopped making it. Cereal isn't worth eating anymore, so I don't buy it or eat it. I would get it if they brought it back just as it used to be.",1167,,,
trottersan,5,"Being a total cereal lover, Fortified Oat Flakes is probably my all-time favorite! I can still taste it's unique flavor. Have tried many 'oat' cereals since, and none come close. Of all the cereals that have gone away, this is the one that I would love to see return. (But only if they used the same recipe that they used in 1970!)",1167,,,
Raised on Post,5,"I have finally found a cereal that brings back the memory of Oat Flakes. Special K Protein Original. Does it taste like Oat Flakes? Who knows, it's been so long. But it sure reminds me of it!",1167,,,
Flake Fan,4,"I miss this cereal too. There are a lot of oat cereals out there, usually in cluster or O's shapes. Why no flakes? They make flake cereals from wheat, bran, rice, and corn. Why is it so hard to come up with and oat FLAKE cereal?",1167,,,
Ritchie,5,Please start production of Fortified Oat Flakes once again! This was my favorite cereal as a kid!,1167,,,
Hoopdawg,5,"Same here, best cereal ever. Why'd they quit making it?!",1167,,,
Gwen Davis Alle,5,This was the absolute best cereal ever! They should bring it back!,1167,,,
OatFlake,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This is the ONLY cereal I would eat until I couldn't find it any more. I had BAD withdrawals for years. I can even feel those symptoms coming back now just thinking about it! I LOVED THIS CEREAL! Why did they take it away... :(,1167,,,
Patricia,5,"If I had a million dollars, I would pay to get the recipe for Post Fortified Oat Flakes! Some mornings, junior high era, I would eat 4 bowls of it!",1167,,,
David,5,One of the all-time greats. There's nothing that even vaguely resembles it - a completely unique taste and texture.,1167,,,
Miss U,5,This was my favorite cereal! I miss it so much! :(,1167,,,
Gaylen,5,"I loved this cereal and I wish they would make it again. I think probably one reason it didn't survive: It tended to get soggy extremely fast. But that is actually something I liked. I hate that 'stays crunchy in milk' became such a fad with so many cereals. Anyway, I loved the taste, and have never found anything that quite compares.",1167,,,
FOFLover2,5,It was awesome. Never understand why any manufacturer of any successful product would stop making it.,1167,,,
Lily526,5,This was my favorite cereal during the 1970s... I was heartbroken when they stopped making it... I can still remember the taste... so comforting. :-) Unfortunately I've never found a cereal that tastes anything like it. Wish I knew the ingredients!,1167,,,

Chuck,5,The executive who axed production of Oat Flakes left Post Cereal and took a job with Lucas Films where he re-edited Star Wars: A New Hope. His next job was with Showtime during which time he was placed in charge of Dead Like Me. His next job was with Fox where he cancelled Firefly.,1167,,,

Rick16,5,Why did it end? Excellent product!,1167,,,
Mike44,5,"I can't remember liking any cereal more than these oat flakes - including cooked cereal. They were very satisfying and tasted really wholesome. Their slight sweetness combined with their subtle toasty flavor - presumably from the natural oils in the germ or bran - made them irresistable. I've often cynically speculated that the reason I craved them so much was because Post surreptitiously added glutamate to them to excite my postsynaptic neurons. Maybe they stopped making them because they couldn't achieve the same flavor profile without it... wow, what a conspiracy theory.",1167,,,

Tami,5,Awe... come on and bring back these flakes already!,1167,,,
jafsie,5,Bring it back! I absolutely totally agree that this was the best most delicious cereal ever especially when you let it get all soggy in the milk! Our family had a running joke that the real reason it was discontinued was because the Jimmy Carter administrations 'Russian grain deal'. We figured they sent all our good oats to the Russians! HA!,1167,,,
Jimmydawise,5,"Why did Post discontinue something I loved. I grew up on this cereal. I use to let it sit in milk about 10 minutes. Then I'd drink the milk out, then eat the flakes that were close to mush. Awesome!",1167,,,
1950sunlimited,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Seriously, if this cereal came back onto the market today I'd be knocking down store displays to get at it. I absolutely loved this cereal as a kid.

I.M.Q.T.P.I.,5,"Loved Post Fortified Oats Cereal in the 70's and 80's. I would totally buy it again but - alas - it is no more. Today I picked up a box of Annie's Organic Frosted Oat Flakes. Not the same as Post - but probably about as close as we're going to find. It's crunchy and looks similar, but it is sweeter and lacks the malty undertones of Fortified Oats. It is good - just not as good.",1167,,,

I love all kinds of oat cereals the most, but there is no comparing them to Fortified Oat Flakes. I wish Post would bring them back without tampering with recipe, maybe they could sell it to Quaker to produce it. It was so full of oat flavor, not necessarily flavored taste. I can still remember the taste now. It's a craving all my adult life for this cereal. So glad I found this website.",1167,,,

It is Popular with people that ate that oat cereal All I have to do is ask someone that was alive when the cereal was available. They all say they miss that one! Now just Upgrade the box design but don't change the cereal recipe! You will have a hit on your hands again. Now just get is out by October 2015 - Ok ? Please!

They said something like their studies don't seem strong enough to warrant it. Yet, I have never known them to even try and sell them in test markets across the States! I also told them that there is no true, simple oat flake on the market, so why not try? There's wheat flakes, corn flakes in many different configurations, but with Honey Bunches of Oats, one can barely taste the oat! And aside from Trader Joe's Toasted Oat Flakes, which have honey and some other sweetener, there is nothing as a pure (Fortified too!) oat flake! Seems an ignorant business move!",1167,,,

teena,5,"As I walk among the fall leaves, I dream of Fortified Oat Flakes cereal Post made when I grew up in the 70s. It was, like a leaf, lighter and thinner than Wheaties, and best of all just slightly sweet somewhat like the pre-sweetened organic wheat cereals I've tried in the 80s. But... NOTHING compares to it especially when it only needed a light dusting of sugar (gotta try that brown sugar suggestion!) to make it palatable to want to eat every breakfast-time and more fulfilling from the let-down sugared ones they have out there now. Come on, do we REALLY need a Reeses chocolate flavored cereal JUST to stuff more than one BRAND on a product as simple as CEREAL?!",1167,,,

I bought every box they had in stock (about 30) and stuffed the car. Unfortunately, they also were no longer going to carry it and were selling their stock out. The place we stayed at provided full breakfast but all I wanted to eat was my Fortified Oats. I demolished the first box but rationed the rest since I knew I would probably never find it again.

They're either basically pure sugar or so bland (healthy?)that half the box gets thrown out do to lack of interest.

Cereal Man,5,Unpopular opinion: Still love it even though they changed the recipe.,139,,,
jpkmets31,2,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Once the greatest, now just an inedible shell of its former self after the recipe change. Classic Frankenberry is my favorite cereal ever. Please bring them back, GM!",139,,,
T. Just T.,2,"Not like it used to be, was good, not good now, will not buy anymore like it is now.",139,,,
Postman,0,General Mills - please bring back the oat based cereal for 2019. Original is better.,139,,,
Postman,2,It is still not oat based for 2018. Such a shame as it was so much better with oats.,139,,,
M.J.S.,2,"I hadn't had Frankenberry in 40 years, but it was on sale for $1 at Dollar Tree. This was NOT the cereal I had as a youngster. Less sweet. Weird texture. I remembered Frankenberry head shapes, not ghost shapes (that's Boo Berry's terrain). I won't bother with the Count Chocula. Hey General Mills, people don't buy these cereals for whole grains. If they want Whole Grains, they'll get some Buc Wheats or something. (Hey, what happened to Buc Wheats?) Post ruined Fruity Pebbles as well. I miss Quake and Rice Krinkles. (and no. Quisp is NOT the same as Quake.)",139,,,
Postman,1,Still the same flavor as last year. Not sure why they don't make it the oat flavor anymore.,139,,,
burnt,1,I loved them until they changed the recipe. Now the texture is nasty. I never would by a box again. I was burnt once. I miss the original Boo Berry too.,139,,,
OldMan,2,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I have to agree with the majority of comments here. The texture of Frankenberry is horrible now. It has a sheen that looks like polyester, and my son is looking at me like, you used to ASK your mom to buy this? The old Frankenberry texture can still be found in Lucky Charms, but of course, without that delicious strawberry flavor.",139,,,
Postman,3,"My wife bought Boo Berry, Count Chocula and Franeknberry at Target over the weekend. No sight of Frute Brute or Yummy Mummy. The cereal is still the corn based but the boxes are still retro with the masks on the back. Please bring back the oat based cereal.",139,,,
Trikygrl,2,Not the same cereal. Marshmallows are different colors and flavors. Also - where they heck are they? I ate half a bowl before getting one! Cereal appearance is also different. Color is not correct and texture is like Cap'n Crunch. General Mills blew it on this one. FAIL!,139,,,
chuckp,2,"I bought a box of Frankenberry, Boo Berry, Count Chocula, and Fruit Brute. Disgusting. I spent time telling my sons how I absolutely loved these cereals as a child. Got home and ate it. Disgusting. We will never buy again, unless they go back to the oat based puffs and add more marshmallows. Very disappointed.",139,,,
Benny,2,"My favorite cereal was Frankenberry back in the 80s. It used to have so many small marshmallows and great strawberry taste. Then one day (still back in the 80s), they changed the formula to more cereal, larger (but way fewer) marshmallows and I told my mom to not buy it anymore. In 2013, I gave it another try and they kept the same terrible formula. The fleecing of consumers, but we're no fools with our pocketbooks. Peace.",139,,,
Insulted,1,"Everybody is spot on... and it's not just these cereals. All the cereals from when I was a kid are absolutely terrible now. I used to LOVE Frankenberry, Count Chocula, all of those cereals (I'm 35 now). I just don't understand why in the world they would change the formula after it was so successful?? There are literally no marshmallows, the texture is horrible and the taste is even worse. Will never be buying these again. Way to destroy a brand General Mills and even worse, way to kill a nice childhood memory.",139,,,
Postman,5,My favorite Monster Cereal when it was oat based.,139,,,
Laurie,3,Thought I was crazy until everyone's comments confirmed my feelings. Sitting here munching a bowl of BooBerry like I did in the 70s and 80s and just couldn't understand what was missing. Heartbroken they had to change it. It's not half as good as it used to be. Little taste. I'm sure we would be buying a ton if it were the same :(,139,,,
TrinaP,2,Marshmallows are half the size that they were 10 years ago. Pretty small amount of them as well. Maybe 5 per bowl. Used to be 2 or 3 per spoonful. Won't buy again.,139,,,
B.S. Now,1,What happened to the powdery oat based cereal I remember from the 70s? This stuff tastes bad. All of the fun sweet cereals I used to love have changed. Bring back the powdery cereal I grew up with!,139,,,
FixItPlease,0,The best comment I see here is in regard to the change from an oat-based cereal to one that is based on corn. The combination of oats and sugar had a much better flavor than the one of corn and corn-based sweetener.,139,,,
quispyjoe,1,(Team Breakfast Member)  The texture is no longer good and the taste is no longer good. The cereal is no longer good. They obviously changed it from the original sweet and tasty cereal. I don't understand - if I wanted a healthy cereal I would buy Grape Nuts. I want sweet and delicious. Who gives a hoot about whole grains. I will never buy this again... I'll just keep my memories.,139,,,
SugarBob,1,"Franken Berry was by far my favorite cereal as a child. My wife texted me that she saw it at the store, and I was thrilled when she bought me a box. Unfortunately, it turns out that it's not at all the same cereal. It uses to be sweet and strawberry flavored and have marshmallows. Now it tastes like the box and I found 6 marshmallows in my whole big bowl. I'm throwing the rest in the garbage. Disappointed++.",139,,,
NotAFanAnymore,3,"I haven't had this cereal in years and was so thrilled to find it at the grocery store. I bought it and Boo Berry but when I served myself a bowl it didn't look the same and it certainly didn't taste the same. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I will not be buying it again.",139,,,
jacky,1,This used to be one of my all time favorites! The box I bought today barely resembled what I remember it tasting like! Bummer. I'll keep my memories... General Mills can keep the new crap.,139,,,
Sad Cereal,2,"General Mills need to pull their heads out of their back sides. Don't pee on my foot and tell me it's raining.... what they're selling now is NOT Franken Berry. Crappy flavor... no marshmallows... fix it or put it in Count Choculas Casket, bury it forever.",139,,,
bartolli,3,Doesn't taste as good as it used to in the late 70's. Bummer.,139,,,
toonswap,5,My all-time favorite cereal... the old recipe of course.,139,,,
Postman,5,Please bring back the oat based Franken Berry. It was much better than the current recipe.,139,,,
bryant,4,"I just finished my first box of this stuff since I was a kid and it has definitely changed. It wasn't as good, but it's still pretty fun.",139,,,
luke,5,"I did contact General Mills and they said that formula was changed. The biggest change was switching from oat base, which I think gave it a more hearty taste. Now it is corn meal based which is more sticky and light. I AM SUCH A NERD!! HELP!!!",139,,,
Sugar Boy,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I recently uploaded an image of the Post cereal cut-out records (Sugar Bears, Archies, et al), and I certainly remember these cardboard records, since I have three. Hey, what can I say. I was greedy. Never gave the chance to let my younger brat... I mean brother score any for himself. Heh heh. In fact, I hogged all the prizes from any cereal we ate. What! I'm sure you people did the same when YOU were young. This one gets a 5 rating from me, mostly for the prizes it offered, which were quite good as opposed to other cereals from those days.",139,,,
Eliot,3,I just ate a box of Frankenberries and there were hardly any marshmallows in that bitch!,139,,,
Shadow,1,This does not taste like it used to. I miss the old cereal.,139,,,
mack,1,"It doesn't taste like it use to. It's a totally different cereal. I wish they would go back, as it used to be my favorite.",139,,,
IcedEarthaholic,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Loved this stuff when I was a kid, love it now. Just as good as I remember it being, love how it turns the milk pink and gives it that strawberry flavoring. Love the monster cereals, so wish they'd bring them back year round so I could get them anytime.",139,,,
Postman,5,Big Lots is having Franken Berry right now. Better hurry as it will be gone soon.,139,,,
ajkiii,4,Is it just me or does Frankenberry taste different than it used to be? Like they changed the formula because I remember it having a more stronger strawberry taste than it does now. I would give it a 5 rating if it was made like it was in the 80's but for now it gets a 4.,139,,,
Postman,5,I do not like the new boxes of the Monster cereals. The monsters seem more scary and less kid friendly. But I will still buy it anyway.,139,,,
Derekdespie,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  We have learned from General Mills that ""Boo Berry"" (blueberry-flavoured), ""Count Chocula"" (chocolate-flavoured), and ""Franken Berry"" (strawberry-flavoured) are finally returning to grocery stores and other fine retailers anywhere across the whole nation around 2011, and almost every year, they'll be available between late August and early December. The 12 spooky-fun marshmallow shapes will be contained in all three Monster-themed breakfast cereals, except that they come in each flavor, just like the corn cereal pieces are in that same shape of each one. General Mills' ""Monster Triple Pack"" breakfast cereal will be finally available in fewer U.S. retailers nationwide - including Walmart, Target, Costco, and a couple of others. It will contain three bags of different Monster-themed breakfast cereals, and will also be available between late August and early December every year.",139,,,
CreepysFan,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Frankenberry has gotten hard to find, so when I do I stock up 4 or 5 boxes at a time. This is the one Fruity flavored cereal I still enjoy.",139,,,

DW York,5,I don't remember the taste other than I liked it. But I remember loving the commercials... and I had all of the figures. Dad had to disassemble the bathroom sink trap to rescue my Grumble. Saved the day! What happened to the display stands that are shown in the photos? I want to buy one.,140,,,
Shaiya,0,This and Quisp were the best. I wish they'd bring them back again.,140,,,
Dooner,5,I still have my little plastic Freakies characters that I sent away for!,140,,,
Rocky D,5,"Original Freakies were one of the crunchiest, best tasting cereals I ever had during my childhood. I remember sending away for all of the plastic character figures - it seemed like I waited an eternity for them to arrive! I wish I still had them today - but not as much as I wish I could enjoy a bowl of that Original Freakies! Come on Ralston! Bring it back for us children of that magical era!",140,,,
Postman,5,I miss Freakies. It was so delicious. Bring it back and let a new generation enjoy it.,140,,,
Vanilla,1,"My brother and I bugged our Mom for weeks to buy this and finally she did. Breakfast came and there we were at the as table excited as we could be... the cereal was poured into our bowls, the milk added, we dug in and excitement turned to horror. This was the worst cereal we had ever eaten. Our mother noticed our expressions and asked what was wrong, we told her how nasty it was, she yelled a bit about how much it cost and that we were going to have to eat it before we could get something else. She said it could not be that bad and grabbing my brothers bowl she took a bite... I am not kidding a bit when I say that she gagged just a little. The Freakies went into the trash where they belonged. This was hands down the worst cereal I have ever eaten.",140,,,

freakiesrulz74,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I am 50 but the Freakies commercial on this site brought back childhood memories! Would like this cereal to make a comeback. Once had the magnets & plastic figures - got a few doubles but finally collected em all!,140,,,
J.G.,5,It sells on eBay all the time... I too am going to get a Boss Moss magnet for memories... Make it again and I will be digging through to find my magnet!,140,,,
Lynxx,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This is yet another cereal from my childhood that simply must return to stores! Today's children would love it!,140,,,
[mrl],5,"The song used in the commercial comes from the popular 1950s song ""The Book of Love"", in which the singer asked the question, ""I wonder-wonder who, who-oo-oo... who wrote the Book of Love?"".

seabird,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal brings back childhood memories like no other! It was not even the cereal itself that made it, it was the characters and their story that carried such an impact. I loved their story, their search for what was true and basic about ""humanity"".

Ernie,4,A childhood favorite! Those Freakies magnets are in this house somewhere still.,140,,,
sweetpea,4,Freakies was a very yummy cereal - another one that should make a limited edition comeback. I wonder who owns the rights now that Ralston doesn't make commercial cereals anymore.,140,,,
Paulie,0,"I loved this cereal. I bought it every week for my daughter, who was 4 at the time, wish they would bring it back! I was the only cereal she would eat. I still have all the magnets on my freezer to this day. They make me smile each and every day.",140,,,
Sugar Boy,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  The beauty of waxing nostalgia. I have a few of these magnets. One of those morning shows (The Early Show, I think) featured a cereal box collector who claimed he payed $500 or traded $500 worth of material possessions for a Freakies box. Un-Freakin'-real!!! No pun intended. Who woulda thunk people would pay top dollar for a cardboard box with pretty pictures printed on 'em. Oi!",140,,,
chopstick22,0,"I want psychedelic, freaky cereals to come back. The 1970's were the best for cereals. They're so boring today by comparison... I mean the boxes more than the cereals themselves. Come on cereal companies, get weird. We like it.",140,,,

Jeff98177,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I have the Freakies Boss Moss magnet.,140,,,
Postman,5,Freakies was one of my favorites. I remember in 5th grade the whole class loved it. One girl did a report on each character and drew their pictures. She did a great job. My dad bought a case of it for my brothers and sisters. Since there were six of us it was gone in no time. I wish it would come back.,140,,,
Rhett Row,5,I still have Freakies magnets on the fridge!!,140,,,

FastEddy,5,Freakies was the best. I miss it. Still have old Freakies toys though.,140,,,
DARKFANG,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was the best monster cereal, yes! even better than Frankenberry, CountChocula, Boo Berry, Wolf Berry & Yummy Mummy Cereals.

I'm 46 now and I can still remember the taste.",140,,,

Lee Torr.,0,Never got to try it but it looks super cool. Love the characters.,140,,,
TorpTown,5,Bring Back the Freakies! Totally remember these guys... Was my all-time favorite cereal. Sure it was alot like Cap'n Crunch or Quisp. But I loved their jingle and the always interesting story pitch with the various commercials... little mini stories. So the cereal always won the vote with all the kids in the house! Used to collect the little toys in the box too. Such as the magnets of the little characters. VERY COOL. Bring Back the FREAKIES!,140,,,
"Jackie, NYC",5,"Well, the reason the second intro of Freakies didn't work is because Ralston gave the account back to the agency but didn't realize I wasn't at the agency anymore. The creative team they put on it decided to change everything about the Freakies and in the process took away all their character and originality. Freakies became a me-too cereal and didn't last a year. (Gosh. I guess I'm still bitter about this!) - Jackie End",140,,,
BossMossfan,0,"Wow, I'm so glad I found this site. I've been searching for the origin of my little Boss Moss fridge magnet. I honestly have no recollection of this cereal but now I know where he's from. It sure sounds good yummy.",140,,,
Mr. Frickey,0,"I don't remember anything about the cereal itself, just the jingle and the name. Growing up with a last name like Frickey (born in '67 so I was 7-10 when it came out) you can imagine how often I heard comments! Never really bothered me, but it is something I have never forgotten.",140,,,
Come Back,5,"This cereal was all I cared about back in the day when a small plastic toy or magnet was so satisfying to search out and collect in a cereal box. I am bummed my kids will never know the simple pleasures I experienced as a child like this yummy cereal. Great cereal, jingle, toys and characters. Perfect marketing and product. Miss it and would love to get a bowl tomorrow morning.",140,,,
CreepysFan,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I also wish they would bring back FREAKIES, It would once more become my DAILY routine. My love for this one cereal has never diminished.",140,,,
Freak Man,5,"I was a huge fan of the Freakies cereal back in the 70's. I can remember collecting all of the plastic figures, balloon cars etc. and still having them even to this day. I miss the cereal a lot and wish that some cereal company would make a come back with it. I can't get that cereal jingle out of my head... lol. Ralston Purina made an excellent cereal and though the boxes weren't very big it was well worth the money for around .69 cents and today the boxes are also getting much smaller for 3 times as much which is a total rip-off but that's another story... BRING BACK THE FREAKIES!!",140,,,
CreepysFan,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Freakies at breakfast, watching tv, snacks, mom couldn't keep enough Freakies around. Still considered my favorite, and I wish they would bring it back.",140,,,
candoo,5,"I was telling my 8 year old daughter about these little creatures I spent hours playing with when I was her age... (I was born in 1964) It finally dawned on me they were from a cereal. I did a search, and realized I wasn't making it up! Wasn't there a tree too?",140,,,
Ms. J,5,"Fuzzymuffins, I got the same looks! I'm glad someone created a ""Freakies"" page for the none believers. I miss freakies. They were so good!",140,,,
fuzzymuffins,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I went a good 20 years wondering if I had imagined this as a child. I kept asking people ""do you remember freakies?"", and even sing them the theme song, and I just got weird looks... it wasn't until I found a freakies website back in 1997 were my memories validated....",140,,,

jonesg,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  One of the reasons the original French Toast Crunch was phased out was because the small ""toast"" pieces were made entirely of puffed corn.

Setzer,5,"Loved this cereal. I was 19 at the time it was released and I remember being at my grandparents house and my grandpa wanting me to try them. Back then I thought this was just 'old people' cereal lol. After one bowl, I was hooked and went out that same day and bought a box for home. I ate this stuff daily up until Kellogg's discontinued it. I wish they would bring it back.",1290,,,
CerealCrusher,0,(Team Breakfast Member) A frosted bran cereal sounds brilliant. Sweet on rich flavor... make 'em bring it back!,1290,,,
snoody05,5,I grew up on this cereal. It would be the only cereal my mother and I would eat. I periodically look for it. I've even looked on amazon for this cereal. Kellogg's - definitely bring this cereal back and soon!,1290,,,
dgarbern,5,"Tasty when eaten dry, but it was heaven with milk. Why was it ever taken off the shelves?",1290,,,

CrystalNet,5,"Just remembering this cereal... it was a favorite of mine until it left the shelves. Currently, and before it came out, I would mix a bran, which now is All-Bran, and Frosted Flakes. Doesn't really compare with Frosted Bran. Please bring it back.",1290,,,
LouLou,5,Please bring back Frosted Bran! It would make so many people happy! I have tried numerous other bran cereals and nothing can even compare to the ultimate... Frosted Bran!,1290,,,

bellyflop,5,"One of the few foods that really, really, really worked with my freaky system. I feel like a freak to miss this stuff so much. But... sigh...",1290,,,
jfox,5,Bring them back! I loved them because they didn't get soggy in milk.,1290,,,
silver,5,The thing about trying to rate this cereal is that many have not tried it since it is no longer available. Kellogg's made a mistake taking it off the shelf. Too bad there are not enough likes to buy the Frosted Bran factory. With 6 kids we used to buy it by the case.,1290,,,
praline,5,"I loved 40% Bran. When they stopped selling it, I switched to Frosted Bran which I found even better. I would eat this for breakfast and dinner many days. I haven't found a cereal that I like since then. I notice that cereal manufacturers really cut back on brands. I wish they would rotate them like the McDonalds does the McRib sandwich or like Baskin Robbins rotates their ice cream flavors. Then I could hoard a bunch of boxes. If their sales weren't high enough, they should relaunch it as a spin off of Frosted Flakes rather than a spin off of Bran Flakes. Then they can try to get the kids and health conscious alike.",1290,,,
D.J.,0,"Loved the Frosted Bran Flakes... I see the regular Frosted Flakes... they are so flavorless and sticky-sweet. Kellogg's could probably frost pieces of the cardboard box, and they would be the equivalent to the regular Frosted Flakes. The Frosted Bran Flakes had a nice nutty flavor, and were lightly sweetened, and low in fat and calories, and were awesome... Kellogg's - please bring them back!!",1290,,,
Twinkletoes,5,"I loved, loved, loved this cereal! What happened to it? Are the Kellogg's people reading these reviews? It would seem that with the healthier trend of the times they would at least try it again!",1290,,,
Babyhulk,5,I always loved Post's 40% Bran Flakes back in the day; loved Kellogg's version which didn't require (for me) additional sugar BUT was not as sweet as Frosted Flakes or another 'kiddie' cereal. Miss this cereal and wish it would come back. Glad to see that I'm not the only one that loved and misses it.,1290,,,
silver,5,"It is very unusual that a family of eight can agree on anything. Frosted Bran was one of those exceptions. Not only our family but the school friends also agreed it was the best out of all the cereals available. Believe me, we tried them all. Sometimes even a snack. When it finally became unavailable at the local stores, we began to buy it by the case until they finally stopped making it. Why is it the few things you would like to see continued get axed. If I could, I think I would buy the plant and start it up again, consumer owned cereal maker, ha. I think maybe the marketing strategy was a little off and the introduction to a healthier food choice was a little to early for the target consumer. Too bad for us.",1290,,,

mona,0,"Has Kellogg's ever asked themselves ""why"" they don't have this cereal anymore? I remain so sad (and hungry).",1290,,,
Mochamunchies89,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  It came out in 91 so I would have been 2 or 3 years old... but I remember this was all I wanted to eat. It was the best flake cereal to me. I wish I had a box right now. lol,1290,,,
mcremeans,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I eat my cereal dry all the time. My stomach can not tolerate milk so I find myself eating all cereals that have sugar on them that are not good for me - with the exception of Frosted Mini Wheats. There is no other cereal with the vitamins and and the grain I need (that I like and doesn't have a lot of fat content in it). Being a vegetarian and recovering anorexic / bulimic, I need the nutrients that I don't get and I prefer a cereal that makes me have a full feeling when I eat it with a cup or two of coffee. When the Frosted Bran Flakes came out, I thought I found the perfect cereal. Then as fast as I found it, it just vanished. I have been looking for it for years what happened to it and why did they take it away. Please bring it back. Apparently, I am not the only one that liked it from reading all these ratings. So if just not for me but for all the adults and for our kids who would probably love this cereal too and we wouldn't have to force them to eat a good cereal. Please bring it back!",1290,,,
Buffy,5,This cereal came out when I was in the 10th grade and I LOVED it! The flakes were great and didn't give me a headache from trying to chew it like the raisins did in Raisin Bran. The best bran cereal ever!,1290,,,
clemmy,5,This was the greatest bran cereal I ever tasted! I miss it so much. My medication messes with my digestive system and this really helped. And was a very tasty way to go about it. I have not found anything to compare with it!,1290,,,
Cool Logo,4,"I liked how Kellogg's put there logo around the box, they've never done that with their other cereals, they should revive this.",1290,,,
Frosted Bran Fan Too,0,I loved it too -- it was gone too soon. That happens with all the cereals I really like.,1290,,,
Wolfie,5,I loved this cereal!! What happened to it???,1290,,,

Wake Up,5,"For the life of me, I just can't figure out why General Mills won't give us this cereal with it's original flavor? They are fully aware that the fans want it. I just don't get it.",154,,,
PRG013,2,My 2 rating is for the rereleased Frute Brute not the original Fruit Brute. The new version has an awful Cherry flavor.,154,,,
Justin,3,"It's BACK (or was) but like all the monster cereals (and many other kids' cereals nowadays, i.e. Pebbles, Corn Pops, etc.), the recipe changed for the worse. The cereal itself takes on the texture of soggy styrofoam (due to the switch from oats to corn, and not being ""frosted"" like the old cereal) in short order, and the flavor is way more subdued than it should be. Still, it's probably the best of the new monster cereal line, but that's not saying much. Shame, shame.",154,,,
zep,2,"Definitely not like it used to be. Way too glazed and too much corn syrup. Probably used to be made with real sugar, not that corn syrup junk. Compare ingredients if you can get them anywhere. Even the grain they use is different, now it's all corn ingredients. I thought it was cool to see it out again. I just wish it was made the same way as it used to be.",154,,,
Bucksky11,5,Probably the most fondly remembered cereal from my childhood. I voted for it best of all time. The 2013 version is not the same cereal but I love the retro box art (Target) and still felt very nostalgic buying a box of Fruit Brute again.,154,,,
Postman,5,Fruit Brute and Yummy Mummy should be back for Halloween this year. Now we have all 5!,154,,,
Mr. Monster,5,He's back!,154,,,
Postman,5,Saw an old episode of Rhoda over the weekend. Brenda was eating Fruit Brute for breakfast although they had a different name on the box but the werewolf was the same. It was from 1976.,154,,,
Ernie,3,Had this only once as a child; it didn't have the appeal of the other Monster cereals.,154,,,
fruitbruteiseh,5,Bring it back at least during Easter.,154,,,
Cerealkiller,5,I miss Fruit Brute. Please brings it back! At least seasonally.,154,,,
Graf van Kurt,5,Very cool. Please bring it back!,154,,,
Hotrod,5,Bring it back - at least around Halloween.,154,,,
John E.,5,Fruit Brute was my favorite. I remember the box being green though.,154,,,
Neil,5,"All the different sugar cereals that I ate as a kid, this is the one I miss the most. If they brought it back, I'd probably by a case or two, so I had some stockpile! GM needs to bring it back!",154,,,
sigmund,5,The fruit flavor and the marshmallows rock! Hope this cereal comes out again for Halloween!,154,,,
McFlyJr1979,5,How have I NOT heard of this cereal yet. I loved Yummy Mummy & Pulp Fiction. :),154,,,
ada4001,0,They always take the good ones out of production. I was also a Freakies fan as a kid.,154,,,
bawbde,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved Fruit Brute! It was the best of the monster cereals!,154,,,
Mark,5,Bring Fruit Brute back!!!,154,,,
Tony,3,"The cereal made a cameo appearance in the 1992 Quentin Tarantino film Reservoir Dogs where it was shown in the apartment of Mr. Orange (played by Tim Roth). Tarantino used the cereal again in his 1994 film Pulp Fiction. Bob Newhart ate Fruit Brute out of the box on an episode of the old Bob Newhart show. With his deadpan speech and mannerisms it was funny, a dry middle-ager eating a kid's cereal. It goes to show that the name Fruit Brute is funny. The cereal is not very good, however.",154,,,
El Whizzo,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) This was always my favorite of the monster cereals. When I saw a box of it in ""Pulp Fiction:, I hoped that meant they were bringing it back, but no such luck. Too bad. Fruit Brute would have torn out Count Chocula's throat.",154,,,
wookie,0,I wish they would bring this back around for Halloween like they do Boo Berry. It would sell right? Just for the novelty if not the taste. I'd buy a couple boxes.,154,,,
Mammoth,0,"Yes Yes bring it back! I've never had it, but it looks good, and I want to try it!",154,,,
owen1,0,(Team Breakfast Member) Bring Fruit Brute back! Bring this cereal back!,154,,,

sullivan6nj,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) Thanks for all of the positive reviews for Nabisco Fruit Wheats! I was the original product developer for this product back in the middle '80s. As someone mentioned, Nabisco sold its cereal business to Post in 1990. After that, I lost track of what happened to Fruit Wheats. It was a fun project as we tried to get as much fruit in the middle as we could!",1328,,,
cereal guy,5,"I hope that Fruit Wheats and Post Toasties will return on Saturday March 7th, 2020, National Cereal Day - the day to bring back discontinued cereals like Clusters cereal, Total Raisin Bran, Total Corn Flakes, Wheaties Honey Gold, original Oatmeal Crisp, Oatmeal Raisin Crisp and Triples cereal from General Mills.",1328,,,
cereal guy,5,"Hey guys... since Essential Waitrose Blueberry Wheats is the closest that we can get to see Fruit Wheats cereal again, get a box of Essential Waitrose Blueberry Wheats cereal from the United Kingdom today.",1328,,,
FruitWheatLove,5,"Strawberry Fruit Wheats still ranks with me, even though I haven't had it in 20+ years. When did they discontinue it? I loved it.",1328,,,
cereal guy,5,"Fruit Wheats came in five flavors: strawberry, apple, raisin, blueberry and raspberry. I still have a coupon for Fruit Wheats. Nabisco doesn't make cereals anymore. Please Post and Malt-O-Meal bring back Fruit Wheats.",1328,,,
cereal guy,5,My prediction is Post and Malt-O-Meal is rebooting Fruit Wheats and Post Toasties.,1328,,,
cereal guy,5,What's the recipe for Fruit Wheats cereal? Since Nabisco don't make cereals anymore maybe Post and Malt O Meal will make off brand versions and bring back Fruit Wheats cereal.,1328,,,
cereal guy,5,There's an email us on the contact page on the Post consumer brands website to bring back both Nabisco's Frosted Wheat Squares and Fruit Wheats cereals from the cereal graveyard.,1328,,,
cerealguy14,5,I used to like to watch their commercials. Nabisco - please bring back Fruit Wheats.,1328,,,
S.F.W.,5,"I remember eating the strawberry Fruit Wheats straight out of the box everyday after school. They were so delicious! Bring them back, Nabisco! *ding!*",1328,,,
S.T.L.,5,"So good! The raisin-filled Mini Wheats are the closest thing nowadays, but nothing beats apple-filled!",1328,,,
Lala,5,"I was so sad when Fruit Wheats stopped being produced! I called the company... And I was only in high school! I would happily buy endless boxes if it were around today, and gladly gain strawberry filled weight!",1328,,,
Shushina,5,I love them... LOVE them! Not a cereal eater but I love these. My 3 year old loves them too. I was so angry when they took them away. Please don't ever do that again. Was not happy. lol.,1328,,,
ZJBull,5,Loved those Strawberry Fruit Wheats... I sort-of went crazy when they stopped producing them.... Bring 'em Back!,1328,,,
SophieMae,5,"Every time I eat Frosted Mini Wheats, I wish they were Fruit Wheats instead. The Fruit in the Middle Mini Wheats are good but not the same. They only have a little bit of fruit in them. I remember when I was a kid - my sister and I would eat the strawberry Fruit Wheats straight out of the box. They were our favorite cereal. If they brought Fruit Wheats back, I would buy a box in a heartbeat.",1328,,,
CralFan,0,Loved the Fruit Wheats cereal! Bring it back Nabisco!,1328,,,
mixem,5,Nabisco made really good cereals back in the day. I see that Kellogg's has a sort-of version of this cereal called fruit in the middle. Has anyone tried that yet? Is it as similar to this one as it looks?,1328,,,
childofthe80s,5,"Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats now makes ""Touch of Fruit"" mixed berry flavor. Very similar to Fruit Wheats. Just got myself a box and they are very good indeed.",1328,,,
La ra,4,I would buy this regularly if it was made today!!,1328,,,
celt42,5,Bring it back!,1328,,,
B.I.B.,4,Please bring back fruit wheat cereal. I really enjoyed this cereal with the varieties. I have not seen anything close to it since. I miss it!!!!,1328,,,
mr.fruity,5,Please please bring the strawberry fruit wheats back!!! Frosted mini wheats aren't even in the same ballpark as strawberry fruit wheats... Fruit wheats are way yummy!!!,1328,,,
Jaci,5,"I love strawberry fruit wheats! You'd make a killing if you brought them back now, with all of the other ""fruity cereals"" that are available. This cereal was way better than all of the new ones!",1328,,,
othfan,5,BRING THEM BACK!!!! Every time I eat other mini wheats I want this kind instead!!! With the strawberry!!!!!,1328,,,
anon,5,Bring back Fruit Wheats!!!,1328,,,

SMarie,5,I wish they would bring back this cereal! It was my favorite as a kid.,161,,,
The Ritty,3,"I believe Marshmallow Krispies and Fruity Marshmallow Krispies co-existed for a bit, because I remember liking the non-fruity kind better.",161,,,
K.J.,5,I miss this cereal! Bring them back!,161,,,
Steve-Os,0,These sounded good. Too bad I was too young to eat sweetened cereals back then. I wish I was born earlier in the 80's to try these.,161,,,
telesitaxhula,5,I want this cereal back. I remember the taste still. It was the best. Please bring it back.,161,,,
Krispies75,0,(Team Breakfast Member) Was it a dream? Are they back? I think that my daughter saw them on TV this morning... cross your fingers and click your heels...,161,,,
bookofsnow,5,I also mix the marshmallows you can buy alone with regular Rice Krispies and it does give a flashback to this cereal but it isn't the same. The marshmallows were little circles and had a very unique taste.,161,,,
Fruity Judy,5,They need to bring this back!,161,,,
bcurry,5,"I talk about this cereal all the time! I would be over the moon if they brought it back, unchanged and original. SO GOOD!! :)",161,,,
Kcereal,5,I loved this cereal. I wish they would bring it back!,161,,,
Justin,5,"God, I miss this cereal (and the REAL Strawberry Honey Comb) so much. It, along with countless other cereals, had too short of a life, and if I remember correctly, was killed off specifically because it had 'too much sugar' or some such nonsense. On one hand, I would kill to have it on the shelves again, but on the other, I know that they would change the recipe and completely ruin it, just as with other great things in history - Monster Cereals, Pudding Pops, etc..",161,,,
HRR 305,5,I would die twice to get Fruity Marshmallow Krispies back! Please God - help us get it back... Kellogg's make it happen and I swear I will eat it until I die... Thanks =),161,,,
Gil E. Anna,5,Please please please bring it back. It was the best cereal ever.,161,,,
Ursula,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  One of my favorites as a kid. If they won't bring back the cereal, maybe they would consider selling the fruit-shaped marshmallows separately. I'd put them in everything!",161,,,
Always looking,5,"I agree with everything everyone has said on here. I too have been looking for this cereal for years. I have found that ""Marshmallow Matey's"" sold at Wal-Mart to compete with Lucky Charms comes pretty close. I too would love to see this cereal return to the shelves",161,,,
Cr.Won,5,"I have found a website online that sells and ships anywhere in the US fruity cereal marshmallows, identical in taste to those found in Lucky Charms. I bought a bunch of bags and now mix them with regular Rice Krispies and, wow, the memories came flooding back! When I remember eating them, I do not recall having Frosted Rice Krispies. I remember regular Rice Krispies. Maybe it was the very early version of them? Either way, I have found the closest alternative by eating the above mentioned, and life is once again whole. Just do an internet search for ""cereal marshmallows for sale"" and you should have no problem finding them. Or, find them on vat19.com. Good luck. Cr.",161,,,
HeatWavez,5,Fruity Marshmallow Krispies was the best cereal ever!,161,,,
FruityMK,4,This cereal had the BEST commercial.,161,,,
Ali J.,5,Please bring it back. I can taste in my imagination now. It had such unusual and delectable flavor and smell. Oh how I miss it. Please - this was like the only enjoyable part of getting up.,161,,,
Snap,5,"Wow, and here I thought I was the only one looking all over for this cereal... That was indeed the only cereal we had at our house, where it used to be Frosted Flakes, but even Frosted Flakes doesn't taste the same anymore either...",161,,,
sweetpea,5,Please bring this cereal back! BTW... great idea from the guy who mixes marshmallows from Lucky Charms with Rice Krispies to try to recreate it. I'll have to try that!,161,,,
D.S.J.,5,"Best cereal hands down! Companies always drop the best eats, like this cereal and remember Teddy Gram Bearwitches.",161,,,
Cappadonna,5,"Every year, I call Kellogg's asking if they have plans to bring it back. They always say ""no"". I loved it!! Getting soggy was never a problem for me. I eat all my cereal in small to medium bowls.",161,,,
mrsbriano,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  OMG... this was my favorite cereal. I used to have it for breakfast and also for a afternoon snack. Complaining about the sogginess is silly if you eat it quickly that would not be a problem. Yum I wish they would bring this cereal back. Most cereal is unhealthy but this was so good. And this was at a time when kids played outside and were not concerned with nutrition facts.,161,,,
IwantMMKrispies,5,"This is far-and-away the greatest cereal ever invented. I would kill for a bowl today... I have found a very close alternative by mixing Lucky Charms and Frosted Rice Krispies. Not the same, but yummy.",161,,,
Momof4,5,This is one of the only cereals I ate as kid!! Why can't they bring it back it was sooooo GOOD!!!!,161,,,

Sojourner,5,I really wish they would make this cereal again. I loved it.,161,,,
SANxJONERO,3,"I remember it being good, but wasn't always in the mood for it. I guess I just didn't love marshmallow enough, or just didn't love the mix of marshmallows & rice krispies enough. I definately do remember that green box of fruity marshmallow krispies though & some times wondered why it never came back.",161,,,

SpaceBarron,2,(Team Breakfast Member)  My rating reflects the current recipe. My rating for the pre-1984 CLASSIC Fruity Pebbles is a perfect 5!,162,,,
timtam,5,"Growing up, my brother and me weren't close but I remember the small things such as eating cereal together... him with his huge bowls of Product 19 and Cocoa Pebbles and me with my bowl of Fruity Pebbles and just watching movies we'd rent from the store or play a video game. I miss those days but I miss spending that time together now we have families and it's changed but I truly remember this.",162,,,
NostalgiaL,3,"Does not hold up well when eaten in a large quantity, but it still has a decent taste for a cereal that's been around for awhile. (I work for a discount store and their version is just as good if not better - and cheaper - hence the okay rating.)",162,,,
jmroszczak,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  It's odd... As a kid, I loathed this cereal. I thought it tasted like vitamins. But as an adult... I kind of like it now.",162,,,
grown up kid,0,I had some Three Twins Lemon Cookie Ice Cream... which oddly reminded me of the taste of Fruity Pebbles (and lemon-creme cookies). Check it out! I haven't had the cereal in many years now.,162,,,
Michele,5,"Fruity Pebbles was my absolute most favorite cereal when I was a kid and it still is. When I have them now, it gives me fond memories of my childhood, watching cartoons with my sister. Definitely a classic cereal.",162,,,
Alphonzie,5,"I loved Fruity Pebbles as a kid and I still love it today, although I only have about once a year now days.",162,,,
DrDollz,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  My Grandson goes through 3 boxes a week.,162,,,
Avrige Bear,5,"Back in the late 1990's, O went to the Family Dollar in my town and found the CANADIAN version of Fruity Pebbles which was different from the USA version I've known for years. This cereal consisted of big pebble shaped corn puffs (about the same size as Corn Pops).",162,,,
Ernie,5,Fruity and Cocoa Pebbles still make it onto my breakfast table when they're on sale!,162,,,
TopCat123,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I used to hate eating this cereal until I was on a blood type diet and I figured that it was my number 1 favorite now that I can't eat wheat or corn. (O+),162,,,
manofmystery,1,Cocoa Peebles are one of my favorites (and the cereal I most regular buy) but their Fruity brother is disgusting. I've never found a more unpleasant tasting fruit-flavored cereal.,162,,,
reggie7,5,I love Fruity Pebbles. No cereal can replace it. I could eat a whole box in a day lol. They are so good!,162,,,
MyEmptyCanvas,1,(Team Breakfast Member)  Fruity Pebbles... NO! This is on my top 10 cereals that I hate list. LOL & to those that can't find it... I see big boxes of the stuff at Super Walmarts and local grocery stores all the time. I travel A LOT! (myemptycanvasreviews.blogspot.com),162,,,
Mcchevy,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I want Fruity Pebbles again, but I can't find it in my regular store. I checked the Post website and there's no evidence that they're discontinuing it. What's going on? I'm really craving it lately.",162,,,
Mcchevy,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) I like Cocoa Pebbles better, but there's something about the taste of these that really reminds me of being a little kid watching cartoons on Saturday morning. A very distinctive taste and smell that wakes up happy memories.",162,,,
Gary,0,"Fruity Pebbles or Cocoa Pebbles? Which do you like best? Discuss. I was always a Cocoa Pebbles man myself, but I do appreciate the other one.",162,,,
b.c.h.,2,"I've eaten fruity pebbles all my life. It is my favorite cereal. However, the last two boxes I have purchased have been barely tolerable imo. Something about the texture. Its as if they have tried to put something in the cereal to keep it from going soggy but the result is almost a stale texture and taste. I'm very unhappy!",162,,,
iowolfman,1,I'll just say this - I love my Fruity Pebbles but the last two boxes I got was stall bad and I'm not happy with that at all. My email is iowolfman@gmail.com So now you tell what up with that plsssss.,162,,,
Tig1,4,I liked this cereal until they changed the recipe. Now it turns to glue in like 20 seconds! tig1,162,,,

Marcell,5,"I tried to find this cereal in the stores after having eaten it for a year when I wanted to lose weight. I just wanted to start eating it again and could not find it. Now, checking out this website, I find it was discontinued. Please bring it back.",1462,,,
Maryann,5,Love it! Please bring it back to the stores! I used to buy 2 to 3 boxes a week but cannot find it anymore!,1462,,,
CJ-3,5,"Yes, I agree with the rest of these comments. I was so shocked I could not find it anymore. I travel so much I just kept thinking they just didn't have it - in fact, I still look for it just in case it comes back. Please reinstate this cereal. It helped me so much on my diet!",1462,,,
Alana N.,5,"Bring this back, along with the chocolate flavor! PLEASE!",1462,,,
Fly Girl,0,"I agree... and didn't know until today it had been taken off the market. I loved it, and ate it every day or at least until I could no longer find it. In fact, I had it shipped overseas to my APO address. BRING IT BACK.",1462,,,
P. Kupp,5,This is only only cereal I really liked. I switched to eggs and toast after it went away.,1462,,,
Gillian,5,This cereal and the chocolate version was the only thing like it on the market. Fiber One substituted this cereal for nut-filled high sugar and high calorie options.,1462,,,
Dobber,5,"I loved this cereal. I ate it everyday, it tasted great and helped me lose weight. I was very disappointed when it was discontinued. I hope it will be brought back.",1462,,,
H. Squares Luv,5,Please bring this cereal back. It's a great product for General Mills and us the Consumer.,1462,,,
I.B. Diabetic,0,"I agree with @saddened. I am totally disgusted this product is no longer available. For a diabetic who used it for successful weight loss (+40 pounds) and tight blood glucose control, there is NO other Fiber One/GM cereal that compares to Fiber One 80 Honey Squares in terms of taste, calories, versatility of use, and nutritional value, especially sugar and fiber content. Its disappearance has presented real problems for me in that I am no longer able to include any cereal in my breakfast meal planning.",1462,,,
Why Guys?,5,"I can't imagine why General Mills discontinued this cereal. Walmart had it for a while longer than other stores, but now I can't purchase it at Walmart anymore! I will just have to look for another brand made by a different company!",1462,,,
80CalLover,5,I ate this cereal every day until I could no longer get it in Houston. It was the best cereal on the market with that low of a calorie count. Hope they bring it back.,1462,,,
R.M.,5,I am very upset that I can no longer find my Fiber One 80 Calorie Honey Squares Cereal or my Chocolate Fiber One 80 Calorie Cereal. What has happened with General Mills that they will no longer produce these two cereals? I wish there was something I could do to get these two products back on the grocery shelves. - Very Upset Customer,1462,,,
Granny-6,4,"I've been looking everywhere for this... my favorite Fiber 1 cereal. I should have gone on the website much sooner and I would have known it was discontinued. I too am most disappointed as I had it for breakfast most mornings. Here in the Rochester, NY area, stores must of put out on the shelves what they had in stock up until early May. Guess I was able to get it longer than others. Should have stocked up!",1462,,,
duro,0,Why did it disappear? Me and my wife liked it a lot. Seems like a lot of people liked it. Sad to see this one go away.,1462,,,
saddened,5,Why would General Mills discontinue such a popular product? Only thought that comes to mind is the profit wasn't high enough. I am totally disgusted with General mills and will try to avoid purchasing any product made by GM.,1462,,,
TrishG,5,"I loved this cereal. I ate it every day. To me, it was the best low calorie high fiber cereal out there that didn't taste like straw!! Please bring it back.",1462,,,
Healthy80,4,I also love this cereal. Bring it back!,1462,,,
Flip,5,I love this cereal and am so sorry it has been discontinued. Please start making this cereal again for those of us that love it.,1462,,,
Disappointed-2,5,What the heck! I eat this cereal every day for breakfast. I am at the bottom of my last box. I can't find this cereal in any stores or on the web. Thanks a lot General Mills. I'll be sure to avoid your other cereals to be safe that the company doesn't discontinue another item I use daily.,1462,,,
stunned,5,This cereal was great! I'm stunned that they chose to discontinue it.,1462,,,
Honey Squares,5,"Our family loved this cereal so much but it became harder and hared to find. We liked it so much that I called General Mills cereal co. and much to my discontent learned that they are not making this cereal any more. I found this web site in hopes that I could get the word out for other lovers, to call and hopefully they get so many calls they will start to make it again. Please call General Mills. Hope this will help put it back on store shelves soon.",1462,,,
Sad Husband,4,My wife loved it but then it was discontinued.,1462,,,
Vicki,5,My name is Vicki. I love this cereal. But I too am having a hard time finding it in the stores. What's up?,1462,,,
SweetLee,5,"I loved this cereal. But for a long time now, I can't find it in any of my area stores.",1462,,,

teresastokes56,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  It's great to see so many fellow Force-lovers here. My 90 year old father was brought up on it and misses it terribly, and so do I! Other wheat flakes are available but they are poor imitations and none has ever had the lightness and flavor of Force. I still use everyday their attractive wheat-ear knives, forks and spoons which we collected piece by piece in the 1970s when you could buy them if you sent off some packet tops. And that is all I have to remember it by. I wonder if the problem started when Weetabix and then the supermarket own brands started doing their own wheat flakes which were cheaper? They are nothing like as good as Force!",138,,,
reen,4,"Last made by Nestles in England about 2011-2012, now discontinued. Very low sales, but never advertised! The dolls were still on sale in 1997 for about three pounds and two packet tops.",138,,,
the boat,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Bring it back now! It's a disgrace that they are taking away memories as well as quality. Shameful!,138,,,
Danforce,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Force Flakes leave the rest behind. They are utterly delicious and wholesome. They must be brought back if a revolution is not to break out. Dan,138,,,

Andy,5,"Being vegan, these were one of just a few cereals I could eat - most being fortified with vitamins and minerals that may be animal in origin.

V. McT,5,I grew up loving this cereal and wondered why I couldn't find it on the super shelves anymore. They should be FORCED to bring it back. (Please excuse the pun.) But I do feel passionate about it. Love & Miss you xx,138,,,
Credo,5,It was the only cereal I liked. All other cereals have too much sugar and salt. BRING IT BACK!,138,,,
Joanne,5,"Not only is it bad that they've axed a cereal I've always loved, but it's impossible to find anything remotely like it. It's frustrating that unlike other cereals such as Weetabix, Bran Flakes and Shreddies, none of the supermarkets make their own version of this one! Why? At least there would be some consolation! Hate when food companies axe perfectly good and long-standing products that many grew up with! Either that or they change the darn recipe!",138,,,
Lauren,5,"I'm only 19 and was introduced to Force by my father years back, and I LOVED IT. If Nestle put some advertising behind it for my generation to hear about it, we may not be in this dreadful situation. We have tried finding alternative wheat flakes but there is NOTHING out there. With no competition, why not fund Force? I can't see why Nestle would support terrible cereals like Cookie Crisp and not Force.",138,,,

Please, someone, start to manufacture and supply these wonderful tasty flakes of goodness again. - Sue",138,,,
Graham B.,5,"Absolutely gutted to find out from this website that Nestle had discontinued production of this amazing cereal back in 2012. It has been my breakfast cereal for 60 years and I was wondering why is was proving to be more and more difficult to find in my local shops. Now I know! My last purchase was from an online store but even these options no longer exist. Surely an English producer could resurrect our 'Sunny Jim' and in the process make all these reviewers happy again. What a challenge!. NEVER MIND ABOUT CHEERIOS - SUGAR PUFFS AND SHREDDIES - Someone, please 'BRING BACK THE FORCE'. Submitted by Dave.",138,,,
Bereft,5,My parents had a letter from Nestle telling them that it was going to be discontinued this year (after telling us last year that production would probably start again in 2013).

Last year, each time I asked why they had none in stock was told that there was a 'problem' but not what the problem was so have been hoping to see it again soon - in vain. I am mortified - I have also grown up with Force - still have a Sunny Jim rag doll and agree with most other comments that it was a brilliant cereal, not least because of the lower sugar content. Criminal that it wasn't advertised - it would surely have quickly become popular again with the right campaign. This is not just nostalgia!",138,,,

shawnbuck,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I absolutely agree. I've been eating this cereal ever since childhood (I'm now 55), and it's easily my favorite. Not too sweet, high in fiber, easy to eat and digest, and no artificial ingredients.

They sent me a letter (along with a",138,,,

H. Oxford,5,"This was a fantastic delicious cereal, but have noticed that all supermarkets have stopped stocking said item, be nice for just for once in a while one supermarket would think 'outside of the box' for a change and put some on the shelves.",138,,,
Mo23,5,I agree with all the comments and would be delighted if Nestle would resurrect this wonderful cereal. There really is nothing to beat it. - Maureen,138,,,
meldrew,5,"If Nestle wanted to sell this cereal in an age where quality wholesome health foods are being actively promoted, they could easily have done a better marketing job. Perhaps another example of a multinational eliminating competition, however small, in favor of selling addictive high sugar / higher profit margin / tasteless ersatz sawdust. I would be interested to know whether the original manufacturing company was profitable before Nestle took them over. Greatly enjoyed the cereal over many decades and even until 2010 was able to buy the cereal in Bahrain where I lived. Dare I venture that another national treasure has been consigned to the scrap heap for the sake of commercial expediency.",138,,,
Patricia,5,Absolutely agree with all the comments above. It is my husband's favourite cereal and today we travelled quite a few miles to an independent grocers who used to always stock Force - but the shelves were bare! I agree that a bit of advertising would have been a great help. We would love to see it brought back.,138,,,
DavidJ,5,Force is unique we cannot find anything else like it. We noticed it had stopped last year as we used to eat it every day in the summer and have done for years. We have been trying to find a substitute but it has been impossible. We won't be buying any of Nestle's cereals after this.,138,,,

My son went off to university so I didn't buy it for a while. After visiting Sainsburys in search of it without any joy, I'm very disappointed. I thought I would investigate and came across this site. I'm really sad. Why do all good things come to an end. I really hope Nestle brings them back. - Anj",138,,,
Bill81,5,So sad - we loved it. Is there nothing we the Force lovers can do?,138,,,
Sunny J,5,Another nail in the coffin for variety. Nestle must have bought Force with the long term intention of eliminating it. They did no advertising to support it so why acquire it other than to remove competition? If they don't think it is viable they should offer the brand for sale to someone who will try. Another conglomerate treading on the little people!,138,,,

Rick052,5,Just to repeat all the other comments. This is the best cereal of all. No other flakes even come close. Have to get Weetabix which is no substitute at all. Come on Nestle.,138,,,
chrissylb,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I've emailed Nestle twice now about the disappearance of Force. In Nov 2012, they said they were planning to bring it back in Jan 2013 but I've just emailed again asking what is the current state of play and they've responded that they are stopping it permanently due to lack of demand. I'm devastated. Like the rest of you Force-loving people out there, I've been eating this wonderful cereal for years, having been introduced to it by my father and still have the Sunny Jim rag doll I sent up for as a child. My grandson also keeps asking me when will it come back? I told Nestle the ""lack of demand"" was because hardly anyone had heard of it - even the staff at Sainsburys where I used to get it. It had been moved to a different aisle on one occasion and when I asked where it was, no-one knew what I was talking about. When I eventually located it and showed it to two staff members, they were completely surprised and said they'd never seen it before. Come on Nestle, why don't you resurrect this greatly loved healthy cereal - re-launch it as a 'retro' cereal and ADVERTISE it for the first time! Let the Force remain with us! - By Chrissy",138,,,

NOBBY,5,NESTLE must bring back this cereal. It's one of our oldest and best. I grew up eating this and was still eating it up to the time they stopped making it. They told me they were to reintroduce it in 2013. Have they changed their minds?,138,,,

aqmax,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  What a shame! Force is a wonderful cereal, and one upon which I grew up. I had the rag doll, T. Towel, poster and the little bus with Force written on the side. Nestle, really should re-introduce it, as it is a healthy option, and even better suited to today's health conscious lifestyles. It is certainly one of their best cereals, and if they promoted it more, it would catch on, being nicer than Kellogg's Special K. The trouble with Nestle is that they do not have any real interest in the companies that they purchase, and it is we, the consumer, who are deprived of something we like!",138,,,

My local Tesco had just started restocking when it was apparently discontinued, along with Sainsbury & Waitrose.

Bring it back NESTLES to the market where it belongs.",138,,,

What can we do to bring it back? Maybe someone like Jordan's Mill could be approached to buy the recipe and start producing it.,138,,,

Should it be called FROOTOOSE LOOPS. If memory serves Toucan Sam's voice changed from a wiseguy Bronks or Brooklyn accent to a Rex Harrison British intonation rather soon in the products history. Sam's Tag line ""Follow your nose..."" when all along he didn't have one.",142,,,

kevtat,5,Vanilla Mini Wheats were by far the best! And they NEED to bring it back!,542,,,
raquel,5,Enough already! I am having bad withdrawals. Please bring Vanilla Creme Mini-Wheats back : )~,542,,,
angela4018,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Still waiting for them to bring this one back! This was the best and hardest to find in stock! Whoever makes the decisions to discontinue some of these cereals doesn't have a clue what consumers like! I need them to bring this back and also Fiber Plus Yogurt Berry Crunch!,542,,,
J.P.,5,Best cereal in the world. Enough said.,542,,,
Zephyre,5,2 years later and I'm still in withdrawal! Best cereal ever made (next to Quisp :-) ),542,,,
Toni B.,5,I loved this Vanilla Cream Mini Wheats cereal! Please bring it back.,542,,,
Neil Wayne,5,Bring these back! Best flavor of Frosted Mini-Wheats ever!,542,,,
Andy,5,The strawberry mini-wheats are OK. The bite-size chocolate mini-wheats are very good. The vanilla mini-wheats were the best.,542,,,
The4englands,5,We always had to shop multiple stores. The vanilla flavor was always sold out every where we would shop and then we were told it was discontinued! It seems crazy to us that they would discontinue a flavor that flew off the shelves at every store! And then replace it with other flavors... Funny thing the original always stocked to the brim! But the flavors they bring out such as the vanilla or cinnamon are always sold out and they discontinued the ones the consumers are eating up!? Someone is not researching what sells. Please someone who pays attention to what IS selling and what IS NOT selling for love of GOD PLEASE... Bring back our beloved Vanilla flavor mini wheats!,542,,,
Sandra,5,PLEASE bring it back!!! I have looked everywhere!,542,,,
yakker,5,I have been so depressed when my store no longer carried the vanilla cream frosted mini wheats. My family and I love them!,542,,,
Missing_Cereal,5,I MISS THIS CEREAL! Did they discontinue this amazing cereal?,542,,,
orwell,5,Please! I love Vanilla Mini Wheats. Bring them back!!!,542,,,
Tasty King,5,I like the Vanilia Creme Mini Wheats it and the chocolate are the only ones that I eat I wish you would bring it back.,542,,,
Sonic,5,Why discontinue something so many would love to see come back?,542,,,
RayRay,5,I miss Vanilla Frosted Mini Wheats. Please bring them back!,542,,,
Lady J.,5,"Please bring back the Vanilla Creme Mini Wheats!!! Those are my favorite, and I wasn't even aware they were discontinued until I noticed they just weren't on the shelves anymore. Why discontinue something so many would love to see come back?",542,,,
snakeriver,5,I wonder if they sell it at H-E-B?,542,,,
frank,5,They were always gone from the shelves here in Florida too. Those were the best mini wheats. Those were the only mini wheats I bought. Why did they discontinue them?! I can't even find a similar cereal from another brand.,542,,,
jboe32,5,Please bring it back!!!!,542,,,
lmf,5,Soooo good. I don't understand why a cereal so delicious and popular would have been pulled from the shelf... but they kept the maple and strudle flavors (in Canada)?? That doesn't make any sense.,542,,,
Joe,5,Frosted Mini-Wheats: Vanilla Creme Cereal was the best cereal ever. I have pleaded with Kellogg's to bring back the cereal.. You can do so also at: http://www2.kelloggs.com/ContactUs.aspx,542,,,
Dean,5,I agree. This was the best cereal in the world and always sold out. Why on earth was it discontinued. PLEASE bring it back.,542,,,
GoGoGo,5,Please resume making the vanilla creme frosted mini-wheats. They were the best!!!!,542,,,
jeff,0,"Kellogg's, why would you stop selling the hottest selling mini-wheat ever. At least that's how it was around here. The shelves always where empty. Come in one day and then gone. That would prove them best to me.",542,,,
quiet,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) Please help!! Vanilla creme is the best of the mini wheats. Lately I can't seem to find them anywhere. Tell me you didn't discontinue them and where can I find them. I live in Lansing, Illinois - a south suburb. Thank you.",542,,,
m.e.,5,Love the taste of this cereal. My favorite. Can't seem to find it now. Wondering if it was discontinued.,542,,,

kim,5,Best cereal ever! Very disappointed they stopped selling it. Please bring it back!,159,,,
E.E.,5,Love this cereal. PLEASE bring it BACK.,159,,,
Big deano,5,"This was one of the best cereals Kellogg's ever made. Far better than any cereal still available, including the ones they sell in the U.K. Please bring this back to market!",159,,,
Belle,5,"My favorite! It's a conspiracy! Everything I like, they quit selling!",159,,,
Tater,5,"Please, please bring this flavor of Fruit Harvest back. It was THE BEST!",159,,,

Kyle,5,Best cereal ever. Please bring back.,159,,,
J.J. Six,5,Bring Fruit Harvest cereal back!,159,,,
taddie,5,Excellent cereal. I wish they would please bring it back.,159,,,
rlench56,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Really Kellogg's? It's so clear that many people loved this cereal, including myself! If it is good for us then why discontinue it? I can ask nicely all day long, but it will not be brought back just because we all loved it. I think we should boycott all Kellogg's products until they bring it back! That's what I'm going to do. Don't know about the rest of you folks. How badly do you want it? Then make some noise!",159,,,
paisley,5,BEST CEREAL EVER! Such a good combination of flavors. Please bring it back!,159,,,

Nick Robbins,5,I have been looking for this cereal and could not find it. This was the best cereal ever. Please bring it back.,159,,,
ficca33,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Please bring back the Fruit Harvest Cereal. The BEST cereal ever.,159,,,
Lveljac,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  The best cereal since Frosted Flakes. I can't believe it's gone - all three variations all gone. I was able to buy the strawberry blend over the last couple of years, but I believe I have purchased all I could find left over in stores (Walmart and Redener's Warehouse Market). The Special K Berry does not compare which is what I purchased recently with hopes of a similar taste. I want the line to come back to satisfy the many customers like me who loved this cereal. Please Kellogg's bring back this cereal or at least 2 of the 3 combinations. I am still searching for a brand of cereal that will have this blend. I am desperate and determined to find something I can enjoy and love just as much or more.",159,,,
tumbleteacher,5,I would like it to come back. I loved the fruit!,159,,,
lakescann,5,"No wonder I couldn't find it - is it discontinued? My other favorite cereal, Special K Strawberry, is just not the same as a replacement.",159,,,
Whoosh,5,My moms favorite cereal. She is driving herself crazy trying to find a replacement she likes just as much. We wish they would bring it back too!,159,,,
quigleymonster,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This was a delicious cereal and I would definitely eat this for breakfast and for snacking. I wish Kellogg's would bring it back.,159,,,

S.P.B.,0,They had a free bubble gum offer.,165,,,
the collector,5,I have three unopened boxes of Ghostbusters Cereal. Reply here if interested.,165,,,
Warlocke,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I used to eat two heaping bowls of this stuff on Saturday mornings, sometimes three if I was being an especially disgusting pig. It was delicious. For a while they were doing boxes that had a hologram of the logo on the front. I still have the hologram I cut out of one, but sadly not an intact box.",165,,,
mistalorio,0,(Team Breakfast Member) Hello Ghost Busters cereal fans. I have 3 Vintage Super Cool Ralston Ghost Busters Cereal boxes for sale. Boxes never opened. Dates back to the 80's.,165,,,
kit316,5,Wish it would make a come back. I would do anything to have that taste back in my mouth again. They could bring it around for Halloween time as a limited edition cereal.,165,,,
The Ritty,4,Loved this cereal. The commercial song is so bad and I remember it's the same one for Ghost Busters II - just the logo ghost is updated. I wonder if those kids got PAID again? ;),165,,,
Willie-11,5,I'd like a case delivered to my house ASAP. So get busy making some more of the Ghostbusters cereal. It was my favorite. Thank you. Now get busy! Wink!,165,,,
Blueberry M.,4,"I had an allergic reaction to this cereal (and to Rainbow Brite cereal too). Despite my allergic reaction, it was still delicious!",165,,,
Geckograph,0,"Three years ago I wrote the first review on these cereals as I have a vivid memory of eating ""Ghostbusters"" cereals with ""glow in the dark"" marshmallows as a kid, around 1985-1987... Maybe was it a ""special edition""? I'm wondering if anyone else remembers eating glow in the dark marshmallows?",165,,,
Tex4,5,I miss this cereal! It was my favorite for the relatively short time it was available!,165,,,
Jeff O.,5,"I have great memories of this cereal. In my opinion, it was the best tasting cereal ever and I don't think there has been another that I've had that has tasted as good. There was something very special about Ghostbusters cereal!",165,,,
McFlyJr1979,5,Who ya gonna Call when you're cereal tries to eat YOU? Fantastic! This was as crazy as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cereal... although green milk was... odd. :-),165,,,
mrPibb7781,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I was an enormous fan of this cereal when I was a kid, mostly because I loved the movie and Saturday morning cartoon. But it tasted great and as a kid, enabled me to think I was a Ghostbuster (because all REAL Ghostbusters eat their own cereal).",165,,,
Co4rocks,5,This cereal rocked... was my favorite. It sucked that it went away. They should bring it back. There was something extra good about even the fruity bit s- like they had extra yum fruit flavor in them. And the marshmallows rocked. Ghost Busters was the greatest.,165,,,
Cereal Person,0,"How did this cereal get get 841 votes yesterday and 22 votes today. It only had a total of 69 votes to begin with and was in 200th place. Now in 2 days it in 20th place.I thought it was a fair place to vote for your favorite cereal, but I must be wrong. Note From Mr Breakfast: Thanks for pointing this out. We look for unusual variations in (or entering into) the top 10 daily, but the rest of the list weekly. We'll run a search for multiple votes from single voters during single days and remove any unfair votes. Thanks again.",165,,,
jaypeso45,5,I loved this cereal. It was my very favorite cereal. Anybody remember Ninja Turtle Pies from Hostess? lol,165,,,
mighty toe,0,"Wait... Wut? The marshmallows glowed (glew?) in the dark? Holy crap! What was in 'em, plutonium!? Stomach tumors and tape worms, here I come!",165,,,
Kwahl,3,I think I remember this cereal when i was a kid... I had an allergic reaction to both this cereal and the rainbow brite cereal by the same company. I don't know if anyone else had this problem. I am giving it an okay because it still brings back some nostalgia for me.,165,,,
GeckoGraph,3,"I remember eating those too but wonder these days if I'd ever eat something that ""glows in the dark"" if it was again presented to me. Somehow makes me feel weird to have actually eaten these glow in the dark marshmallows...",165,,,
Chasya,5,I remember hiding in the closet and eating all the marshmallow ghosts. I miss this cereal. :),165,,,
c-loc,5,Great cereal!! I remember eating this when I would get home from school and watch G.I. Joe and Duck Tales.,165,,,

Tina,2,Golden Grahams changed its recipe in 2016 to something more natural. Just tried it and the Wegmans generic dry (which did not follow suit) and the generic is WAY better. I couldn't even finish the name brand!,168,,,
mrfacefur,5,Probably my favorite cereal. Often makes me feel a bit icky after eating it for one reason or another but it's usually worth it.,168,,,
Dezzie,5,"I love it. Sometimes the cereal tastes like honey cinnamon graham crackers and when I finish all my Golden Grahams, it sort of turns my milk kind of yellowish but - in other words - I love it.",168,,,
CerealCrusher,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Delicious... but no more honey! Aldi/Millville's Honey Grahams still does, also swapping brown sugar for molasses in the private label recipe... their graham squares are a little more fragrant and a bit softer, too.",168,,,
timtam,5,Great cereal and the taste has not changed. Our taste buds have over the years. It's a great cereal and rather healthy if you eat it with 2% organic milk or almond milk tastes really good with this cereal. Some said it gets soggy quick... that's when I love it the most lol.,168,,,
Al Jordan,4,"Wow, I remember a time in my life (mid-teens to be exact) when I was hooked on this stuff. The taste was so great, I thought it was the best cereal I'd ever tasted and I wouldn't eat any other brand. Eventually, though, I (nearly literally) got sick of them and stopped eating them for a while before going back to trying them again. Nowadays, I hardly see it anywhere on the shelves of any of the stores I browse or shop at. But if the previous comments about how the cereal tastes today are anything to go by, I suppose it's all for the better. Still, in it's earlier days, Golden Grahams had something going for it that seemed to please my tastes at that time.",168,,,
bribuffalo ny,3,It no longer tastes like when I was a kid.,168,,,
comicman,5,Does anyone remember in the 90s when Golden Grahams gave away mini comics. Ii think it may of been the beano or the dandy (for uk versions). I'm desperately to track one of these down!,168,,,
Cherylmotherof2,2,"(Team Breakfast Member)  It doesn't last in milk - gets soggy as soon as milk hits it. I bought this cereal only to eat dry but now with no honey, I wish they could make it better so it would not get soggy. That's why my kids don't like it.",168,,,
SZA,3,"This cereal does not taste the same as it did when I was a kid back in the 80s. It is nothing special now, whereas back in the 80s it was definitely one of my favorites! The pieces seemed heartier and probably sweeter back then. Having said that, I will say that it made an amazing ""bedside cracker"" when I was in my 1st trimester of pregnancy. They always say you should eat Saltine crackers to help combat morning sickness, but the thought of munching Saltines first thing in the AM made me feel even sicker. Golden Grahams hit the spot, though! They were nice and sweet and crunchy. I always had a little Tupperware container of them by my bed for about the first 6 weeks of my pregnancy. :)",168,,,
Ernie,5,So delicious... I can never just eat one bowl of this!,168,,,
SpaceCadet,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I freakin' love this cereal! Been one of my top favorites since I was a kid... Still eat it!,168,,,
MyEmptyCanvas,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  When I was younger I used to LOVE this cereal. It actually was dang near the only cereal I'd eat for a time then! I give it a 4 rating only because, although still decent now -- they are not as they used to be. I haven't had them in years, but do recall a flavor change after the '90s ended. (myemptycanvasreviews.blogspot.com)",168,,,
SpaceCadet,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I LOVE GOLDEN GRAHAMS! One of my absolute favorites.,168,,,
AnnieBrazil,0,"I love Golden Grahams, always have and always will. I buy a box every two weeks at least.",168,,,
Applewood,5,"My favorite of all cereals. I personally don't think it tastes different from when I grew up, so if they made it healthier and taste mostly the same... bravo!",168,,,
Joe Spliggins,3,They were a lot better in the 70s.,168,,,
j.n.,3,"Golden Grahams NO LONGER CONTAINS HONEY in the ingredients list. Like many products, this one is no longer as good as it used to be.",168,,,
Mac,5,They make GREAT S'MORES!!!,168,,,
falfa,5,"Everything is great about this cereal, except for the price!",168,,,
PC,0,Yum!,168,,,
Tina Scott,5,"Oh those Golden Grahams... Oh those Golden Grahams.... Crispy, crunchy, graham cereal... a brand new breakfast treat...",168,,,

Creditor48,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Thank you all for letting me know I am not alone on this one. So I have searched the internet rigorously for a single picture of the box I remember which was white with blue and a picture of a milkman and maybe his truck along with the figure 8 shaped cereal but have not been able to find any trace of it. I did find a good video from Cereal Time TV - Graham Crackos (1978) published Feb 10 2018 which clears up the question of why some people remember the three hole kind and other remember the figure 8 variety. Apparently the figure 8 type was made from 1981 till 1983. I was voter,684,,,
MrMustard,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Echoing all of the comments here. This and Golden Grahams were my childhood favorites. At least Golden Grahams are still around.,684,,,
Georgia J.,5,Loved this cereal just as much as you all mentioned. Let us know if it ever comes back.,684,,,
cereal guy,5,I've found out who played George the milkman. It was Herb Vigran who portrayed George the milkman from 1978-1981.,684,,,
K. Logg,5,"I've seen discontinued cereals doing a come back the last couple years, French Toast Crunch, Oreo's, etc. Don't know why Kellogg's doesn't bring this back, heck they can eliminate one of the flavored Special K's, or another multi flavored cereal to compensate.",684,,,
Troy J.,5,This cereal should make a come back. Whose brilliant (sarcastic) choice was it to take it off the shelves.,684,,,
Jabbo,5,I wonder why companies decide to discontinue cereals that we all liked while they keep the same old ones for years and occasionally add different flavors to them them. This one should have stayed around a lot longer.,684,,,
Christine-3,5,I NEED Graham Cracko's to come back! I've been craving it for years.,684,,,
j.p.m.,5,LOVED this cereal as a kid. Also could not remember the name only the milkman. Would like to taste it one more time before I die!,684,,,
colossus,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) Jointfilms is absolutely correct. They are available in Australia. (I'm from Melbourne). In fact, according to one internet source, it is Australia's 2nd most purchased cereal. (After Sanitarium's Weet Bix). It has been popular since it's launch (late 70's or early 80's here). Don't know whether ours tastes the same, but you could give it a try. You may be able to purchase online, although the postage cost may make it expensive. Nutri Grain is marketed quite differently - As an energy or sports cereal, especially towards teenagers,and sponsors sports (The Iron Man Competition) and we are told that the shape is supposed to represent cricket bats. It is considered a very Aussie thing to eat for breakfast and very much our own, even though we know Kellogg's is a US company. (The power of marketing) It would be interesting to find out in which country it originated in. Check out the TV commercials and the Iron Man competition on youtube. Cheers.",684,,,
Dieselsmoke,5,What can we do to bring this back. I've seriously been craving this since my childhood.,684,,,
naduah,5,OMG... I loved this cereal. I was (and still am!) crushed that it was taken off the market. Nothing compares to it... we would buy this all the time if it came back.,684,,,
Nevets101,5,Legendary.,684,,,
jbardi,5,BEST CEREAL EVER.... I couldn't remember the name of this for YEARS... All I remembered was that there was a milkman in the commercial. The cereal shape is supposed to be the carrier for glass milk jars that the milkman carried around. Kellogg's needs to start making this again. No cereal has ever tasted as good.,684,,,
R.R. Bot,5,The day the local grocery store stopped carrying this was a very sad day.,684,,,
cerealjunkie#1,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Absolutely, positively the best cereal EVER!! C'mon Kellogg's... bring this back to us fans... PLEASE!!!",684,,,
Sunny J.,5,This was a favorite of my mom and me! We talked about it for years after it was discontinued.,684,,,
Jointfilms.com,0,I think they still make these in Australia but they're called Nutri Grain. I had them when I was there.,684,,,
Cracko Kid,5,What happened to Graham Cracko's? I loved this cereal.,684,,,
bawbde,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I remember loving these as a kid! I couldn't remember what they were called, and have been searching for the name. I didn't realize it was so long ago... I would love to have these again@",684,,,
BrianG,5,How long has it been gone? I STILL eat bowls of graham crackers in milk with a spoon as homage!,684,,,
paige,5,This was the best cereal ever!,684,,,
Plan A,5,"Maybe if everyone bombards Kellogg's with requests, they may give in. Tell them this is what the customers want.",684,,,
BangBangPow,5,I want it back... please!!!,684,,,
realdeal,5,I wish they still made this cereal. It was the best.,684,,,
jprophet,5,The best cereal of all time!,684,,,
cboyd1971,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Can you still buy this cereal anywhere?,684,,,
Mosae1856,5,I've been asking people if they remembered this cereal for years and nobody does! I couldn't recall the name. This and Quisp were my two faves as a kid.,684,,,
yumm,5,"My grandma use to have this cereal, and I loved it. I did not remember the name of the cereal..... thanks to this website I am no longer raking my memory to figure it out :)",684,,,
wackocracko,5,"When I was really little I had these at a neighbors house, they were soooo good. Then later my mom started buying Golden Grahams and no one would believe me that they used to be different!! Well I guess I WAS wrong after all, they were 2 different cereals. Now I have to find a box of graham crackos (along with a box of quisp). I don't know why all the obscure cereals were the best.",684,,,
Wussup cracko,5,"After my wife and kids saw the commercial, they now understand the little jingle I sing EVERY morning when I get milk out of the fridge - haha",684,,,
Aunt Beff,5,"THANK YOU MR. BREAKFAST!!!!! Everyone thought I was MAKING THIS UP!!!!! I used to LOVE this stuff! I tried to help them remember by telling them about George the Milkman, but NO ONE could relate. Ahhhhh.... I am NOT insane!!! (well, at least not for being the only one that could remember Graham Crackos!!!!)",684,,,
Cracko lover,5,My brother and I used to eat a box a day it seemed... wish they'd bring it back!,684,,,
Lenny,5,It was the best.,684,,,
JB,5,Easily my favorite after all these years! Wish they'd bring it back!,684,,,
DaveinMI,5,One of the best cereals ever!! Kellogg's needs to bring it back !!,684,,,
italiris4,5,"Oh my gosh, this was my favorite cereal!! I was nine years old when this cereal came out and I loved it. Too bad they don't still make it.",684,,,

Jamajo,5,"Best breakfast cereal ever is 1/2 Grape Nuts and 1/2 Grape Nuts Flakes, mixed. Indescribably delicious!",175,,,
Nutzy,5,This is one of my favorite cereals. I understand the ingredients listed and it tastes great while providing fiber. I would like to try a gluten-friendly version replacing the wheat.,175,,,
cerellvr,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Love this cereal. A box lasts forever and it's so good on ice cream or over yogurt as well just with milk.,175,,,
Starlancer,5,I love a bowl full with a sprinkle of sugar and a couple of handfuls of raisins!,175,,,
Donnie D,5,I love them with hot milk! I just nuke them for 2 minutes.,175,,,
Wendy Lou,5,"I've always just LOVED Grape Nuts! Did anyone mention here that you can eat also them like oatmeal, warmed up with milk? Either way, I love them!",175,,,
J Art,5,"My 3rd fav milked cereal from childhood... and back then, as I recall, something of a real chew-challenge....I still enjoy a box or two a year, although they seem easier to chomp... boohoo.",175,,,
Don Wilson,5,"Friends, have you ever found yourself rushing out in the morning because you weren't hungry, or didn't think you had the time? You can't do a man-sized job on a bird-sized breakfast, you know. Nutrition experts say that morning is the time when we should stoke up, and get at least 1/4 of our daily nourishment. Nutrition experts also recommend a whole grain cereal, and that's Grape Nuts and Grape Nuts Flakes. Both are Basic 7 foods, outstanding in both their whole grain nourishment and their zesty crispness. So, eat a good breakfast, do a better job, with those toasty-brown, malty rich, sweet-as-a-nut Grape Nuts or Grape Nuts Flakes, for extra swell eating!",175,,,
GrapeNuts Nut,5,"Post added soy isolate to Grape Nuts in 2013 in a misguided marketing effort to capitalize on the ""more protein"" fad. Consumers must have thoroughly rejected this addition, as 2014 brought the soy-free formula back to the market!",175,,,
Rich-madison,0,Who eats this stuff? Maybe people feed it to their horse. Or their rotten kids as punishment. Awful bowl of pain.,175,,,
Postman,0,"I don't care for Grape Nuts, but I LOVE Grape Nut Flakes.",175,,,
Ron B.,5,I love them - my second favorite cereal after Force.,175,,,
boatwright,5,I bake with Grapenuts all the time. I just add a 1/2 cup to my muffin and coffee caker recipes and it makes the texture a lot better. Love it as a cereal too.,175,,,
A Burke,5,"Thanks for posting our commercial video (""Mrs. Burke, I thought you were Dale!""). Come visit our website for much more about that Grape-Nuts commercial and some behind the scenes photos: http://burkesgrapenuts.com",175,,,
Wilson,2,New recipe - not the same taste. Post recently added soy protein to the ingredients. I don't like the new taste. I'm going back to Cheerios.,175,,,
Onatu,5,"I remember being introduced to Grape Nuts as a kid and finding them terrible plain. Thankfully, my parents showed me how awesome they are when you pour the milk in and microwave a bowl of Grape Nuts, then top it with fruit or honey. That was fifteen years ago now, and I actually prefer eating Grape Nuts cold now. Still, gotta have that honey, fruit, or even cinnamon (well, it's fine without those of course). Overall it's my favorite cereal ever - and it's great to mix with Honey Nut Cheerios or Honey Bunches of Oats!",175,,,
Chomper01,2,"Grape Nuts, huh? Ought to have called it ""Gravel"" cereal, because that what it tasted like when you ate them with milk... Crunchy Gravel. (LOL) Other than that, it was pretty good stuff when served as a topping on yogurt, pudding or ice cream.",175,,,
mobygrapenut,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Been loving those crunchy things since I was a little kid foraging around in my grandma's pantry for illicit snacks. Back then the ads said ""They fill you up, not out"". In the early 70s, Ewell Gibbons pitched them, saying that the reminded him of wild hickory nuts. From my teens to early twenties, they became a staple food. Then, Post began the ""Are you good enough for Grape Nuts"" campaign. I found that so ridiculous that I quit eating them until a couple of months ago. I've been really enjoying them.",175,,,
Sheila D.,5,"I've been eating Grape-Nuts for a long time, since I was a teenager fifty years ago. I use a small bowl, Splenda and unsweetened soy milk when I want a snack that is filling but isn't too sweet. It does have a mild laxative effect but I think that's a good thing.",175,,,
MyEmptyCanvas,1,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I remember trying these in the 90s and I hated them. I thought they tasted like sticks and were as hard as rocks! Then I tried them again about 2 years ago and nothing has changed. When I'm ready to have a bald mouth, I'll pick up a box. Until then, these will continue to sit on the shelf at the store. (myemptycanvasreviews.blogspot.com)",175,,,
Daddio,3,"I was remembering when the box used to say, ""May be habit forming"" on it as did anything that was considered a laxative. I've never really liked it as a cereal, but love it mixed into yogurt and on ice cream. It's funny now to see that there used to be claims that it cured ""the drink"". Wow, C.W. Post was a huckster. I am grateful for both the Danny Thomas Show and the Andy Griffith Show which came about as a result of Post Cereals. Especially for Danny Thomas in that he created the St. Jude's Hospital.",175,,,
Royce,0,Worst cereal ever. It's too crunchy on minute and then to soggy the next. I'll never understand how it's so popular.,175,,,
jerry,0,When did they use the boats for premiums?,175,,,
Cincinnati Kid,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Always liked Grape Nuts. Sometimes can be a little hard to swallow without something to drink (besides the milk they're in) them with. I remember in the old ""Post Tens"" packages (ten little boxes of individual cereal sold in one package), there was only one box of Grape Nuts and usually two of almost everything else.",175,,,
ilovemybrybry,1,I can remember my brother and I flinging these across the kitchen off our spoons the one (and only) time my Momma ever bought them... YUCKY!,175,,,
freetoyinside,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Grape-Nuts! one of the best. It's the one cereal I found in Grandmas cupboard that I actually liked to eat. Hot or cold they were good. Grampa on the other hand wouldn't eat'em called'em buckshot! or bowl-gravel! What can I say he was eating All-Brand or Shredded wheat, both had the fiber and the taste of the box they came in.",175,,,
Joe Spliggins,5,One of the best cereals ever! Try it hot with a drizzle of honey and you'll slap anybody that trys to feed you oatmeal!,175,,,
Curlytop,5,The only cereal that grows in your mouth. I love it.,175,,,
sjoiii,4,(Team Breakfast Member)  An old but great standby that I have been eating for over 60 years. A very strong tasty flavor but its consistency does not agree with everyone.,175,,,
c-loc,4,A bit like eating gravel but they taste very good :),175,,,
healthnut,4,I agree with Mix Master. Glad to see I'm not the only one that mixes Sugar Smacks (original name) with Grape Nuts. That way I can tell myself I'm eating something healthy!,175,,,
Mix Master,4,"Try Grape-nuts mixed with Honey Smacks or any sweetened puffed wheat, really good!!!!!",175,,,
Dee Dee D.,5,I eat grape-nuts with a couple teaspoons of sugar on it... delicious! Great cereal! Fav!,175,,,

Here kitty,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This weekend, I looked at all our local supermarkets and was told by Dierbergs that Post who is the distributor had discontinued the product.

It has everything I like about a cereal that is nutritious and delicious at the same time. It literally is a trail mix of delicious taste and fabulous nutrition for everybody. And it might even help me with my diabetes situation. I mean it. If this cereal can be brought back to the supermarket shelves, believe me it will be sold out in minutes; especially the Cranberry Vanilla flavor. Please reconsider and put this cereal back on the store shelves. My feeling why this cereal was pulled was because there were not enough cranberries to make adequate stock for every grocery store chain. Please bring this cereal back. It is a much needed food source. Thank You, Darrel S.",1004,,,

I am savoring a bowl at breakfast every day, but a little of the punch is gone, knowing when I get to my last box in a month or two, there is none left. I agree with ""zoom"" that the Raisin and Almond flavor isn't nearly as good... the raisins turn to hard chewy things in milk. I pick them out before pouring the milk.

Postman,5,Such a delicious cereal.,167,,,
Marj,5,Love just eating it right out of the box! Can't seem to find it in the Wal-Mart stores lately. What happened?,167,,,
julieyas,5,"I love, love, LOVE this cereal! Did I mention I love this cereal?!",167,,,
FatsILLmatic,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  One of my top 5 favorite! They should sell the milk! One of the best cereal milks to drink! Definitely leaves your urine smelling like the cereal after you eat it. Same thing with Kellogg's Smacks which taste very similar to Golden Crisp but doesn't quite have that texture and hint of honey! I always hated when someone buys Smacks instead of Golden Crisp. Even the Malt-O-Meal version is better than Smacks! Oh don't act like y'all always got the cereal in a box! Some of y'all got them bagged up cereals!,167,,,

KrackenPax,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Out of all the seasonal, regional, or gimmick cereals to grace our shelves for a brief period of lives, Good Morenings made a bold impact, swiftly taking the top position on my list. Needless to say, this impact did not dull over time; newer additions to the list challenged it but always came up short. As far as I have tasted, no knock-off brands truly stack up to the taste; the authentic waffle crunch should be undiscontinued. To summarize, best cereal ever.",1515,,,

FatsILLmatic,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Had both this and Waffle Crisp at home at the same time. One from Mars supermarket and one from a super Wal-Mart. Exactly the same thing. I ate all four boxes. I bought 2 Waffle Crisp & 2 Good Mornings Waffle Crunch! I live in Baltimore county.,1515,,,

Postman,5,I finally found Grape Nut Flakes in my local Food City in Chattanooga. It was even on sale. I had two bowls last night. So glad it is back. The flavor is still the same.,176,,,
Postman,5,"Not sure I believe Post's response of a shortage in production schedule to accommodate the most popular items. In the several stores I have been in, GNF was the only Post cereal that was bare and all the rest were fully stocked. GNF sells very well in the stores that I shop in that carry it.",176,,,
Postman,5,Post better not discontinue Grape Nut Flakes. It is a delicious cereal. It's funny that they cannot produce this cereal but it's one of the flakes in Honey bunches of Oats. Would they not have to produce it to put it in that cereal? My fear is the shelf space at stores for GNF will now go to other cereals.,176,,,
Coachrick,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Here's Post's reply to my to my question about what has happened to the availability of Grape Nuts Flakes: ""The item you are looking for may be out of stock for 2-5 months due to adjustments in our production schedules to ensure the items in highest demand are available. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. We will continue to work to get all of our items back on shelves as soon as possible."" So the good news is GNF has not been discontinued. It seems like the huge demand for cereal caused by the pandemic has led Post to concentrate production on the brands they sell the most. GNF just seems to be another victim of COVID-19. Let's hope it recovers!",176,,,

He didn't know when (or IF) he would ever get another delivery of this cereal, so I may have finished the last 2 boxes of this cereal on earth.

flight777,5,"Grape Nuts Flakes is one of my top 3 favorite cereals of all time! It's simple and more nutrition-oriented than most but the flavor defies the ingredients. Even though it has a relatively low sugar content, I have never needed to add any sweetener. Apparently the way it's made produces a unique sweetening effect that is also present (but not as pronounced) in regular Grape Nuts. I have eaten this cereal for 30+ years and never tire of it - though I do switch around what I eat for variety. I was sad to see Walmart stop carrying Grape Nuts Flakes last year (2017) here in Oregon. The only place I've been able to buy it lately is WinCo. Walmart, please bring this cereal back! And please Post, never discontinue this product! It is one of the few great tasting, healthier cereals of all time! David L.",176,,,

O/FROM40S,5,"It appears the folks reviewing GRAPE-NUTS FLAKES are all fans who are hurting from the decline in availability. Not all of their hurt is caused by Post. GNFs are still available in some stores, scattered around the country and on various sites on the Net but every where I see them they are price inflated. While most cereals are priced in the $3.00 to $4.00 range in stores GNFs are always $5.00 or more. On the internet sites the price seems to run between $5.00 and $7.50 per box, plus shipping. Most sites want you to buy multiple boxes to further increase their sales volume. Pursuit of the old profit bug-a-boo I guess. Gross more dollars and to heck with other peoples problems. Of course supply and (especially) demand could contributed to some availability problems. But thanks to grandma and grandpa AND to mom and pop, kids of this and the previous generation has been liberally inundated with all of the readily available sweet and sugar covered things one sees in stores these days. How can they know any better? If kids learn to select foods by sweetness instead flavor how can they be expected to appreciate the delicate and nutty smoothness of GRAPE-NUTS FLAKES? So that again goes to reduced demand and there-fore reduced profits, hence reduced supply. Vicious circle, huh? I, too, regret the loss of the old style larger flakes. They kept the crunch to the bottom of the bowl.",176,,,

Chesterfield J.,5,"PLEASE Post, do not discontinue Grape Nut Flakes. Walmart and Food Lion apparently do not stock anymore and it is my favorite cereal. Where in Richmond, VA can I still buy it?",176,,,
Postman,5,Wal-Mart has been discontinuing a lot of items lately. They do this every so often. Usually it backfires and they start carrying the items again. I know that I will be going to Wal-Mart less. They also discontinued my JFG Coffee.,176,,,
Nuts for Flakes,5,Wal-Mart has decided to NOT carry Grape-Nuts Flakes. I contacted Post Cereals and got this straight from their representative. Now that I can't find them there I have no idea where to buy them which is a shame. I hope Post won't stop making them!,176,,,

They are the only cereal I eat, and usually don't get breakfast until nearly lunchtime as I care for both parents and don't have time to eat. They are the food for two meals a day.",176,,,
pmu,5,"You can find grape-nuts at Big Y in Enfield Ct. I hope they will continue to carry my favorite cereal Big Y is the only store that does, I don't understand why. There is one problem with the new size box the new box is 18OZ from 14OZ and it is way to tall for a normal lazy susan or cabinet, they should have made the box wider instead.",176,,,
bill,5,I love this cereal (Grapenut Flakes) and there is only one store here in CT where I can buy it. However the last two boxes l had purchased must be lacking a little quality control. They were both loaded with burnt flakes. I never saw this before and was wondering if they might be experiencing some problem which I assume will eliminate these little black flakes. Thanks for a great cereal.,176,,,

Joe,5,Best cereal I have ever had... I really wish GM would bring it out again. I would spend all my money and break my diet if they did. I would seriously buy a pallet of this stuff!,185,,,
ardentgailla,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was one of my favorite cereals. I still crave it sometimes in my adulthood. I would take an off-brand version of this, too.",185,,,
ColdFusion,5,"This tasted really good as I recall. Very satisfying. The 'mystery' aspect failed though... I distinctly remember you could tell the flavor based on whether the seam on the piece was in the center, off-center, or near the edge. Oddly enough, I remember that yet I don't remember there being non-filling pieces.",185,,,
JJ-One,5,I got a box of this cereal at a discount store one time. It reminded me of Captain Crunch but with a tasty filling. Shame the kids didn't take a shine to it back when it first hit the shelves. :(,185,,,
jmroszczak,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This is definitely the best cereal I have ever tasted in my life (that went away). And I only had it 2 times. Both times were at a sleepover.,185,,,
jamesyug,5,"You know, I have noticed that a lot of you say that you couldn' remember the name and that you have been looking for it for years. If you really loved it like I do, you would've never forgotten the name. I could never forget the name of something so life changing.",185,,,
bethywethy17,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I remember begging my mom and dad to get me this cereal. Why I ever begged I'm not sure.... lol :p I thought this was one of the nastiest cereals I ever tried. I don't even think we ever repurchased it. Lol. I don't think it was sold for very long either.,185,,,
jamesyug,5,I have been saying for the last 15 years that I would give all of the money in my bank account for one box. It was my favorite cereal back then and I still have dreams about it. I cried when they took it off the market.,185,,,
BinkBink27,5,OMG me too. I've been trying to remember the name and no one ever knew what I was talking about and then the other day it just popped into my head! I think I was 6 when this yummy treat was gone for good! Feed My Hidden Treasures Need GP!,185,,,
Joe Treasure,5,"I would take a life, for a box of this cereal... General Mills, I will be your hit man and you can pay me in Hidden Treasures.",185,,,
junkiebutt,5,I will pay handsomely for an unopened box of this cereal.,185,,,
Gigiaproo,5,"Bring it back. I would buy $10,000 worth. Awesomeness!",185,,,
tj311mx,5,I finally found it! I've been trying to describe this cereal to everyone for years! Lol,185,,,
NY Mark,5,I really wish they would have a come back for this cereal. It would be good for business for sure.,185,,,
Rainyday,4,I swear to God the box design was different. Am I crazy? I remember the cereal displayed in a treasure chest. That's how I remembered the name of the cereal by remembering that chest full of cereal. Anyone?,185,,,
leshea6,5,"If this was brought back, my grocery cart would be full of it! Yummy!",185,,,
Mandie,5,"I've been looking for this for years! I remember it had strawberry, grape, and an orange filling. Was good for a 4 year old. Probably wouldn't taste nearly as good as it did then, but I want to experience it once more.",185,,,
Rehclip,5,"Every time I go down the cereal isle, I'm always looking for this very cereal - or something like it. Krave doesn't cut it - I'm a fruit kind of guy, not chocolate/vanilla. What's funny is that looking it up, I see all these comments on how it's advertised as a mystery of what's inside, that kids enjoyed the suspense of not knowing what's inside (or guessing what it was before they ate it). I don't remember ever doing that at all. I didn't care. I just thought it tasted good.",185,,,
Ronnie5,5,I loved this cereal. Please bring back Hidden Treasures!,185,,,
Gina G.,5,This cereal was so awesome. Maybe Kellogg's will take their Krave cereal and try fruit fillings to recreate it. I hope so!,185,,,
S. Panda,5,Dear God - please bring this back!! No one understands the awesomeness except the few of us that were lucky enough to have it before they ripped it from our sticky little kid hands! I bought 2 boxes of the Fruit Loops Hidden Treasures just because I thought it might be similar.,185,,,
Skyla,5,Please bring back Hidden Treasures! It's a lost 'treasure' from my childhood!,185,,,
Big O.,5,I loved this cereal. I wish they would bring it back! Krave have nothing on this cereal! Please bring it back!,185,,,
Amy11,5,Loved everything about this cereal. Great taste and it was fun. BRING the TASTE back! Please!,185,,,
nostalgic hero,5,I always remembered this as robot cereal... now from seeing the picture I know why I called it that.,185,,,
rebecca r.,5,Please bring it back. Reminds me of being at my Grandma's house. So much so that I can feel how I felt while eating the cereal. I would give anything to re-live that. She has been gone 4 years now and things aren't the same. Please bring this cereal back.,185,,,
Found It!,5,I knew this existed! I remember getting this in grade school. Nobody ever knows what I'm talking about.,185,,,
Gary DK,5,Found it! I was struggling for weeks trying to remember the name. I loved this cereal in grade school. I thought the robot on the box was so cool. Hidden Treasures really was a hidden treasure! Now I sound sappy. Oh well. It was the best!,185,,,
Msilva,5,I can still taste it now! I almost thought I was having false memories but here it is. Please bring it back!,185,,,
GoGoDancer,0,My all-time favorite cereal! I really wish they would bring it back.,185,,,
Spinja King,5,Dear General Mills... Please bring this cereal back!,185,,,
R. Crandle,5,"Omg, me too! Nobody else knows what I'm talking about but it's the best and they need to bring it back!",185,,,
michelle,5,"Ah man, I miss this cereal and nobody I know remembers it. I knew it existed. I'm not crazy.",185,,,
daniel,5,I grew up with this cereal and it was my favorite! Don't know what happened to it but it needs to be brought back!,185,,,
Minibeast,5,I miss this cereal so much! I totally remember eating it for the first time as a kid at my grandmas. If I had a box I'd eat the whole thing right now!,185,,,
Shae,5,This was my all-time favorite cereal growing up. Wish I had a bowl of it now.,185,,,
deetex,5,This was some very good cereal. They should bring it back. That would be great.,185,,,
LiLi 14,5,I have been trying to figure out this delicious treat for the last 5 years! But I finally found it! If this cereal came back I would probably cry out of excitement! BEST CEREAL EVER CREATED!,185,,,
Kat77,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Nostalgia! I miss this cereal. It was my favorite when I was a kid (I'm 27 now). I wish they would bring it back!!,185,,,
sabrina,5,"Wow! This was my favorite cereal of all time. I've been asking my mother, family members, everyone I know if they remember the cereal ""with the roboty thing and colorful center"" for over 10 years! I FINALLY FOUND IT. This was the greatest cereal of all time. Still my favorite EVER. I wish they'd bring it back. I'd pay over $500 for this memory inducing cereal. Ugh! GREATEST CEREAL OF ALL TIME!",185,,,
Toya,5,"I absolutely love this cereal, I wish they would bring it back. I am 28 and have been asking for it.",185,,,
Cookiez,5,This was a very unique and wonderful cereal! Loved it as a kid! I miss it!,185,,,
C.L.N.,5,"If I could get a box of this cereal for my daughter, for Christmas, I would win the 'Best Mom Ever' award. She loved this as a kid and keeps asking, at age 23, when it is coming back!",185,,,
Howcliche,5,I've been trying to figure out the name of this cereal! This was my favorite as a kid. They should bring it back!,185,,,

buffbills,5,"I still have dreams of this cereal- really, really great dreams. I miss it!",185,,,
emerald,5,They so need to bring this back. I ate it when I was like 6 and I'm 25 now and it's still my favorite to this day.,185,,,
iluvbf,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved, Loved, LOVED this cereal. Loved it!",185,,,
J dub,5,"I need this cereal back on the shelves, I am so addicted. PUT IT BACK NOW... please!!!!!",185,,,
SC,5,I used to LOVE this cereal! I would definitely buy it if they brought it back : ),185,,,
Ash D,5,This is my all time favorite cereal!! General Mills needs to bring this product back ASAP! I miss it :(,185,,,
Laeh,5,"I loved this cereal. Me and my brother and my sister used to eat this cereal all the time. We wish you could bring this cereal back. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.",185,,,

nicky c delgadi,5,I was 4 when I had my first bowl of hidden treasure and now I'm 22 and I think they should bring it back. I want my children to taste the same thing. Hidden treasures come back!,185,,,
roger,5,So good!! They need to bring it back. I am 22 and have been craving it ever since they stopped making it :(,185,,,
Kat,5,This was my fav cereal when I was a child it was the only one I would eat than they stopped selling it... I am still looking for it and I am 24!!!,185,,,
Chris,5,Best cereal ever!,185,,,
Dan,5,"I have to agree, this cereal was amazing. My parents only bought it once if I remember correctly, then when we went to get more they'd stopped making it. I'm 20 now and I'd eat this cereal everyday if they brought it back.",185,,,
Chelsea,5,"I would pay as much money as I possibly could just to eat this cereal one more time. I am 24 years old. To me that cereal is like childhood in a box. I want some so bad. It was like a breakfast adventure. Can they just bring it back already. Seriously, I think I am about to tear up.",185,,,
crisco,5,"Same here (loved this cereal)... I'm 23 now, and I still miss this cereal.",185,,,
Godiva,5,I LOVED this cereal when I was little. I was so mad when they stopped making it :(,185,,,

Postman,3,I thought it tasted different also. Not as good.,192,,,
Chris6,1,"My suspicions were confirmed... the formula for this cereal changed. It used to be my favorite, not it tastes like a dry sponge.",192,,,
Postman,5,Original Honeycomb is back at WalMart. My daughter and I have eaten half a box. Thank you Post. You listened to us.,192,,,
jim,2,"The new Honey-Comb cereal is not good. As a kid it was one of my favorites and it was one of my daughter's favorites also. She can't stand it and neither can I. Post changed this along with Alpha-Bits and both were a lot better before the changes. If you're listening Post, bring back the old cereals.",192,,,
Postman,0,Has anyone heard if they are bringing back the original formula? I do not see anything online or on the Post website. I hope this was not false information.,192,,,
LibbyD,2,"I was unaware that they had made a new Honey-Comb cereal and unknowingly picked up a box of it last week. It's horrible! It tastes like cardboard! I have eaten this cereal since I was a kid, I am now 54 years old and will have to find another cereal now. Ugh.",192,,,
Postman,0,This is great news. I am sure the sales of the new one have plummeted. I can't wait.,192,,,
Jimi Mack,0,Just heard from the people at Post and come this May/June Honeycomb will come in both NEW and OLD formulas. Look for a Blue-Retro box in stores soon. Why they will keep the new recipe is beyond me though. It is just nasty!,192,,,
Postman,1,The new recipe is just nasty. The people at Post who did this should be fired.,192,,,
Andrena,2,It changed. There is a coating on the cereal. I liked it better the old way.,192,,,
John-8,1,Their new recipe will make you want to eat the cardboard box it comes in instead of the cereal.,192,,,
foqus,1,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Made the mistake of buying a box last week, not knowing that they had change the recipe/texture to an artificial, hollow-corn tasting disappointment. I have sworn off Honeycomb forever now.",192,,,
bowlinsuzy,1,What did they do to my Honeycombs? I haven't eaten them since I bought the new box and looked at all the stores for the old box. Hopefully they will change them back to what they were.,192,,,
Postman,1,I hope Post looks at General Mills and how they are bringing back the original Trix. They need to bring back the oat based Honeycomb. The corn based is terrible. They changed the flavor years ago and it was a bust also. Seems like they would have learned.,192,,,
Big Len,2,I don't like the new taste... too much like corn. Why would they change something that was good and make it corny.,192,,,
Postman,1,"Had more than half a box of the 'new' Honeycomb that I had to throw out. It was really bad. Please bring back the original. I bought some for my daughter. She told me they changed the flavor. I tried it and it was not good. Instead of an oat flavor, it is now a corn flavor. It is horrible. Not sure what Post was thinking. Bring back the old version.",192,,,
Murray Ky,2,"Went and got my Honey Combs like I usually do every week for the last year... box had a different face on it. Didn't think nothing of it. Brought my dry cereal to work like always, awful! No taste, the texture doesn't look the same. Why do companies change things that aren't broken? Might be trying to save money, don't know, but it will cost in the end when people stop buying. Guess I'm back to finding something else.",192,,,
comehair,5,Awesome cereal!,192,,,
NostalgiaL,5,"Take a bow, Post, for keeping this cereal as delicious as it ever was! (Still trying to figure out the ideal milk-to-cereal ratio for this one...)",192,,,
oarias,3,(Team Breakfast Member)  The only thing good about the cereal was when they had the mini-license plates in the boxes.,192,,,
Al Jordan,5,"One of my favorites as a kid. Still enjoy it today, just not as much as then after having doubts as to whether actual honey was used as a sweetener. On a side note (since no other poster has mentioned it - so I will), the Honeycomb Hideout TV ads of the 70's were referenced in an episode of Futurama.",192,,,
Robnoxious,3,"Regarding cereal premiums: I hoped for the '69 Cougar. Got the Marauder, instead. Didn't like the cereal enough to try my luck again.",192,,,
Wazz Better B4,3,Loved it as a child in the 70's & 80's. The taste today doesn't compare.,192,,,
Chomper01,5,"Another story that was listened to on the Honey Comb Ghost Story Record was ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"". I had that record as a kid; and enjoyed the yummy tastes of the cereal while watching the commercials in the 70s. Those were the good old days! Thank you for bringing back the memories.",192,,,
grinder,5,One of my all-time favorites. Fun to see the Honeycomb hide out commercials again!,192,,,
michelle.m.,5,I love Honeycomb. It makes me feel better. Wholesome.,192,,,
MyEmptyCanvas,1,(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal was reminiscent of Styrofoam peanuts with a hint of honey. No thanks. (myemptycanvasreviews.blogspot.com),192,,,
Postman,5,Love Honeycomb!,192,,,
Ken,5,Come to the Honeycomb Hideout! Great cereal and those commercials from the 70's and early 80's were the best.,192,,,
yayaya,5,It's great. It's still one of the best cereal.,192,,,
freq a zoid iac,4,"I loved it as a child. I have not had it in years, I don't think I would enjoy it. If they had a true honey sweetened version, I may like it. My taste buds are way different now. Anyways, like CerealKiller said, I also DID eat a whole box once, in well one sitting. The only cereal I eat now, is non processed oats. BORING! hahah ;)",192,,,
charli20,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I was in a Honeycomb commercial filmed in Arizona in 1965 and would love to see it now as well as show it to my children! mcphersonanne@cox.net,192,,,
TexasJen,4,(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved the commercials with the Honeycomb Kids in the Clubhouse. Please show more of them.,192,,,
CerealKiller,5,Still one of the greats. So tasty I can eat the whole box at one sitting.,192,,,

Hot Doggie,5,Bring back the Hunny B's !,206,,,
Butterfly,5,"I really miss these. The original Hunny B's that were available in my area were the striped, sweetened 'B' shapes, mixed with tiny glazed graham cookie replicas of Winnie and friends and they were absolutely addictive! Unfortunately a year later they'd recreated the cereal, this time minus the graham cookie additions, and though it was still delicious (and cute!), the loss of the extra crunch and variety that the grahams provided was noticeable. Not much longer after that and the cereal disappeared from shelves altogether. :( I've read other reviews that some found this cereal in a reincarnation with the honey flavored 'B' shapes mixed with powdery pink Piglet shapes. I'm seriously hoping that they bring this cereal back someday, because I'd love to try a honey 'B' shape + graham cookie characters + sweet, pink Piglet version!",206,,,

Our family would stock up 4 boxes at a time so we wouldn't run out, then suddenly Post discontinued this flavor. They claim they now have 17 other flavors, but realistically, who cares? Why are they trying so hard to get us, the consumers, to buy their less-than-adequate (aka crappy) other flavors when they had a stellar peach product that worked beautifully? It was selling off the shelves! I guess Post doesn't need the $$$ we peach-lovers would gladly pay to have our requested product come back on the market. And obviously Post doesn't care about customer satisfaction... they've proven that to us. As a result, I don't buy ANY Post products now.",521,,,

zeroday1,5,I don't know why this cereal isn't available any longer. I'm quite shocked that Post would discontinue such a popular and delicious cereal such as this. I use to love putting fresh blueberries on this particular cereal but now my blueberries will have to be lonely before they're eaten. :( I don't know if it has to do with the price of peaches but I would rather pay a little more for something this good than to simply watch it disappear.

Strawburry77,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Best cereal ever! I buy it regularly.,187,,,
ipeters61,5,This is the BEST CEREAL EVER. It's the first cereal I ever remember (other than maybe Honey Nut Cheerios). I alternate between two cereals each morning and this cereal is always one of the two.,187,,,
Alan McDonald,5,Fantastic. Being a diabetic this puts the right touch on a cereal low in sugar yet delectably delicious to the taste buds. Surrounded by a wonderful team approach this breakfast cereal is truly a hit. Thanks Post!,187,,,

Ernie,5,This is the type of cereal I can eat all day... and I have!,187,,,
WizKidz,5,This one gets my vote for the greatest cereal of all time. I buy two boxes every time I go to the grocery store... more if it's on sale.,187,,,
sarah reyes,0,I enjoy this cereal more than any others.,187,,,
screwedupmuzik,4,(Team Breakfast Member)  Very tasty cereal. Too bad it has some bad ingredients such as High Fructose Corn Syrup. I love it but I don't eat it anymore.,187,,,
Postman,5,This is a great tasting cereal.,187,,,
Kitty,4,"If it currently the most common Cereal I buy. It has a thorough blend of taste that makes it easier to satisfy a large household. There have been a few cereals to try a large blend, but after I had this I did not care for them any more. The market shelves seemed to reflect this as well. My surprise was the time it took them to have such a variety as they do now. You could accept it was younger, newer, and not available in all grocery stores yet for years. But by the time we passed 2000 most stores around me had dumpped similar products, even finding it impossible to make mimics with their value brands. You won't be lectured by your doctor for eatting it but people still prefer fresh fruit on it. Children will enjoy eatting it but they don't have a beloved mascot on the box. It doesn't get soggy fast but it still can get soggy. I would give it a five but I know the taste isn't perfect ten, there also isn't a cereal mascot so until recently I would have considered it's box and advertiseing a three. However, now the company employees are feeling like the mascots and they finally added some varity. The appearence should be about 3-3.5 but the Factory Workers are doing their job. The experience of eatting would work as a 5 but small children and people with certain allergies may not enoy. I'd balance that out to 4-4.75 depending on the person. But since I can't vote that way, I've given then 4 out of 5. I would describe each type of Honey Bunches of Oats differently. The original provides every bite and the milk with a pleasing weak sweetness. I cannot think of anything else providing the same experience when chewing, as you have such a mix of rough crunchy clusters that you bite through but land into a padding of either soft or fragile flakes. In my experience though, every batch turns out differently.. both in taste and ratio of Bunches to Flakes. Some times my flakes are burnt, other times I barely find any bunches. Although things seem to have improved in the last couple years, I still get those mishap boxes.",187,,,
LSS,5,I love the combos... the perfect cereal for me... I like the almond kind and add chopped dates.,187,,,
Statman,3,"I agree with ""Oat Flake Lover"" about someone stuffing the ballot box for Honey Bunches of Oats. I was checking out the vote total on Oct 9 and after a few seconds I hit the refresh key and around 10 more votes showed up! Caught in the act. From 40 votes to 107 votes in less that 24 hours. I have been monitoring the votes of several key cereals for several months, looking for statistical anomalies. This certainly is abnormal. In my opinion, about 67 votes should be taken away from Honey Bunches of Oats total to reflect the true sentiments of honest voters.",187,,,
Oat Flake Lover,3,"Something looks fishy here in the voting for Honey Bunches of Oats. It went from 59th place (having 40 votes) to 25th place (94 votes) overnight, after having languished near 60th place for months. Is someone from Post stacking the deck? Are they embarrassed that their discontinued cereal Fortified Oat Flakes is much more popular than most of their current brands? Honey Bunches of Oats are fairly good, but far inferior to Post Oat Flakes (or Fortified Oat Flakes). I wish Post would put some Post Oat Flakes in their Honey Bunches of Oat recipes.",187,,,

homealot,5,I really loved this cereal. I have looked at every store I can think of and have gone online several times to see if I could order it. It reminds me of the Kellogg's Corn Flakes I grew up with but just stepped up a notch. Please bring these back or at least make it so we can order them.,201,,,
HoneyCruncher,5,Used to eat this by the box in 1999. Late night snack and early morning. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!,201,,,
Brownson,5,"I miss this cereal so much. It is hands down my favorite all time cereal. I don't get why they would discontinue it... well obviously it wasn't profiting the company, so I guess the question is how were people not buying this awesome cereal... best ever. I would buy it online and have it shipped from anywhere.",201,,,
Erica,5,This was my favorite cereal and I just happened upon this thread when I was looking to see if I could locate anywhere.,201,,,
S-money,5,"I can not describe how good this cereal tastes. Almonds, honey and crunchy flakes are delicious together. It's the perfect breakfast cereal. If you could put it on the shelves for a little while each year... that would be great. Thanks!",201,,,

Chuck O,4,"I miss this cereal too. There was also a 1 minute version of the commercial that only aired on cable channels since air space costs less. My daughter was in the commercial (can see her head and her hand holding the box while running through the field). On the full version, she's actually ""in"" it.",201,,,

Todd B.,5,I love this cereal and want it back. How do you let Kellogg's know that everyone loves it.,201,,,
BestOne,5,"I love, love, love this cereal! It is the greatest ever. I actually tried to find a box a few months ago because I had forgotten about it after not seeing it for so long. I was not happy when I didn't find it. I tried the new one with peanuts and honey and it sucks big-time! It's totally disgusting! Don't waste your money on that stuff. It doesn't hold a candle to honey crunch cornflakes!",201,,,
Sy G-nett,5,"When I was younger, I ate this every morning before school! I hated getting up at 5 AM, but I LOVED coming to the ""breakfast table"" for a bowl or three of this stuff!! Really wish they'd bring it back... wish just once at least, so my 20 month old could taste her mommy's FAVORITE cereal! Oh welp :( but, J.V., I'll try their new one. I was thinking about it for a while, and think it may be their way of redeeming this GREAT cereal... we'll see.",201,,,

clearman,5,"Loved the stuff, want it back badly.",201,,,
J.V.,5,"I LOVED this cereal too. But last week I found Kellogg's Crunch Nut cereal and I'm pretty sure this is about as close as we're gonna get. I think it's a little sweeter -- there's some sort of ""glaze"" on the flakes but it's really good! Give it a try!",201,,,
btups11,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Why would they discontinue this cereal?? Especially when they came out with a lamer version (taste o honey)!! Discontinue regular cornflakes, and bring this great cereal back!!",201,,,
keychain,5,I loved this cereal. It was my favorite. Please bring it back. I can't understand why it left because the shelves at Walmart stayed empty.,201,,,
PradsPrincess,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I absolutely loved this cereal!!! I am not a cereal person, and am allergic to milk, but for this cereal I trudged through the discomfort! Where did it go & WHY???",201,,,
Buffer,5,"I ALWAYS used this for the topping on my hashbrown casserole! It was the perfect touch of sweetness to the hashbrowns. I was very upset it was taken off the shelves. I have tried to duplicate it by adding honey to corn flakes, but it's not the same!",201,,,
L.L.1,5,"Firstly, I have been a devotee of Kellogg's Corn Flakes for most of my life and I mostly dislike sugary cereal (with the exception of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes once in a blue moon). I tried Kellogg's Honey Crunch Corn Flakes when it first came on the market back in 1996 and instantly fell in love with it. Then, just as suddenly, it disappeared from store shelves and I cannot, for the life of me, understand why. Please bring it back... I miss it!",201,,,

Mara,5,ALWAYS had a box of Quaker Honey Graham Oh!s in my cupboard for 15+ years... until Quaker sold it to Post. It WAS my all-time favorite by far. Very sad that it is no longer is being made with the same recipe and quality.,195,,,
Colleen R.,5,One of my favorites growing up. Haven't been able to find it lately. But I'm pretty sure they still make it.,195,,,
Dan,5,"I honestly can't comment about how good or bad the cereal is now, as I haven't eaten the cereal in probably a decade... but WOW, that cereal [at least used to] be Delicious! Perfect balance of crunch and milk absorption, flavor and texture and glaze. Mmmmmm Mm!",195,,,
KelseyBrad,1,"I grew up eating this cereal and it was always one of my favorites. I bought it recently and it was awful! The taste has changed, the texture is weird now, and just overall I hate it. I miss the old cereal and refuse to buy it until it get changed back to the way it was.",195,,,
grumpyldgrandma,5,Really really really LOVE this cereal! Can't believe Post makes it now because it is AWFUL! I wrote a letter to Post to tell them how bad their knock-off OH's were and they never responded. Figures.,195,,,
Uh Ohs,0,What happened to my Oh's! Just got a new box. Sucks.,195,,,
Indy,5,I love this! Why can't I buy it anymore? Post brand is awful!,195,,,
Ekim,1,"I loved Quaker Oh's. Now that Post makes them they are terrible... poor flavor, gets soggy fast, the recipe changed, higher calories, etc. I'm done with them now.",195,,,
Crimson17,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Love this cereal. It is my favorite! Pop in two cups the next time you make Chex Mix... it is GREAT!,195,,,
Jean2,1,"I loved Quaker Oats Honey OH's but now that Post is making them, they have eliminated 99% of the middle ingredients and now this cereal sucks. Good job making a great cereal gross just so greedy people can make a few more bucks.",195,,,
JayHawke,4,Post now makes this cereal formerly made by Quaker Oats. Pretty good stuff. Crunchy and with a good flavor. I did like the nut variety that has long been discontinued. You can still find this at Target and Wal-Mart.,195,,,
haven,5,I love Oh's so much! The flavor and crunch is just perfect. But why are the boxes so small? Give me more Oh's!,195,,,
labyfan,5,I loved this cereal as a child. It was my favorite. I was so upset when we couldn't get it anymore. Now I find it's still available in the U.S. I wish it was still available in Canada.,195,,,
MyQ,5,"Honey Graham Oh!s is simply the greatest cereal of all-time. It's the cereal that will make you go ""Oh!"" If you have never tried this hidden gem, give it a chance. You'll love every bite.",195,,,
Bryan Ellis,5,I love this cereal BUT I WAS VERY UPSET when I brought a box that was PRETTY BAD!! I would have never thought this cereal would ever ruin my day. Guessing it was a bad batch.,195,,,
Levi Paul,5,My all time favorite cereal! The only thing that would make it better is a BIGGER BOX!,195,,,
Doodle,5,One of my all time favorites... and the only thing I'm really craving with my pregnancy!,195,,,
Pinstripe,5,Best cereal ever!!,195,,,
Good Value,5,This is a great cereal and I'm worried about its recent acquisition by Post. I hate most cereals by Post. Why would they do this? I've eaten them since they came out when I was a kid. I agree about the box being too small. It's usually a great price though.,195,,,
meatball jr,5,Best cereal ever. The only problem I have is they need to make bigger boxes. I can eat the box all at once and still want more... lol.,195,,,
lisa francis,5,"Walmart, Kroger, online, Target... It's a new age people. If you're reading this... you can find anything including Oh's.",195,,,
chic2550,5,I luuuvvvv Oh's. I absolutely hate soggy cereal. Oh's is the only cereal that lasts as long as the milk and the crunch stays good to the last drop. I wish Honey Oh's were still being offered in the Virgin Islands. What a bummer!,195,,,
Tilly,5,I love these. I can't find them anymore. Please tell me they are still making these.,195,,,
crzy4cereals33,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal is great. The taste is perfect - wouldn't change a thing. It's a little rough on your mouth but it's worth it! But seriously, why is the box so small? I can't even sneak a bowl without my son knowing I had some of his favorite cereal.",195,,,
JimMcNimity,5,Best cereal ever! Wish more people new about it and it was sold at more places!,195,,,
e.b.,5,I can't believe this isn't in you top 200 cereals. Anyone else feel as though it gives you a weird waxy mouth? Not sure whats up with that but I still love the stuff.,195,,,
hellokitty12204,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I never liked cereal, but now WOW I love this stuff but can only find small boxes about 2 bowels per box... LOVE THIS STUFF!",195,,,
Matt,5,My only complaint is that the box is too small! This is the best cereal I have ever tasted and I hope it never goes away!,195,,,
Tieti,5,I'm surprised that this cereal is rated so low on your list of the top 100 cereal. It's one of my very favorites.,195,,,
cerealguydude,5,Best cereal ever!,195,,,
Ohsrocks,5,I find it at Walmart!,195,,,
Steveorino,5,"Man, I am so happy to read these comments. ""Oh's"" is an amazingly awesome cereal - yes, very true. Great tasting. So much so, that I try hard to only eat 1 bowl! Often times, I have (3) in one sitting. What comes after awesome? I'll check that instead! Thanks guys!",195,,,
Oh No!,0,"The new version has a slightly bitter after taste. What happened to the original version? This used to be the very best tasting cereal. By the way, you will find it consistently at Target.",195,,,
Found Some,5,"I just bought a bunch of boxes from a CVS, hopefully your CVS will have them too!",195,,,
Pats fan 12,5,Oh's are clearly the best cereal anyplace on the planet! It stays crunchy in milk. And is so good I'm hooked for life... God this stuff rocks!!,195,,,
Syn,5,"The best cereal in the world and for a long while the most inexpensive when they printed the price on the box. Whenever I mention it and someone confesses to not know about it or have never tried it, it takes all that I have not to take them to the store and buy a box and dare them to eat just one bowl.",195,,,
grniz25pf,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This is my boyfriend's favorite cereal but I can't find it anywhere. How can I find it?,195,,,
BZA,5,"My girlfriend had never heard of ""Oh's"" and I had to lecture her for twenty minutes before coming on this site and declaring my loyalty to the almighty delicious Oh's!",195,,,
Oh! Yeah,5,Great cereal but hard to find with any consistency. Will look at the dollar stores since no major chain seems to carry it around here and the small stores are hit and miss every week.,195,,,
J. Jay 11,5,No other cereal stays crunchy so long in milk. I love the sweet taste. Why is it so hard to find?,195,,,
evalon,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Delicious cereal. Unfortunately, I haven't found it in our area for 2 or 3 weeks. Hope it will be available again soon.",195,,,
mariam,5,"I wanted to know if it is healthy. I'll keeping loving it, but just curious.",195,,,
Jenny,5,This is my favorite cereal ever! I Love Quaker Oh's! Awesome!,195,,,
family2011,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This is the only cereal that I look for. They must be great. I've never went online about a cereal before.,195,,,
Crystal37,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I love this cereal! I've been having trouble finding it lately but I'm def gonna look at DollarGeneral!,195,,,
mouseman,0,"Best cereal ever!! My official dessert with almonds, of course.",195,,,
DanaDana,5,Dollar general is the best place to get it. 1.00 for 6.3oz. It is the best deal. Great cereal.,195,,,
Will C.,5,I just found $1 boxes at Dollar General : ),195,,,
Ekoberry,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Way too much sugar for your health, but such crunchy goodness! I've seen small $1 boxes on sale at CVS (Los Angeles area)",195,,,
nono,5,Stays the crunchiest in milk the longest. Amazing complex taste for a breakfast cereal.,195,,,
Ari,5,"I'm a cereal fanatic, but this is literally one of the best foods I've ever tasted. I would keep an entire closet full of these if I could!! Such a shame they aren't commonly available though; I can only find them at Genuardi's.",195,,,
cupcake,0,Bring back the crunchy nut ones that taste like peanut butter.,195,,,
august16th08,5,"I love this cereal, its my fave! Tastes great dry as a snack too!",195,,,
house m.d.,5,My boyfriend also introduced me to Oh's... they're oh soooo good!,195,,,
Yo Ho Ho,5,I never heard of this cereal until my boyfriend introduced me. I'm obsessed!! It's SO yummy!,195,,,
CerealKiller,5,This cereal is addictive. You can eat the whole box in one day.,195,,,
Thanks-Os,5,"I love this cereal. This is the only cereal I will eat. When I go into Wal-Marts to find this cereal, there is usually only two left on the shelf so I know others enjoy this cereal as much as I do. I live in Warrensburg, Missouri and I can always find this cereal at Wal-Mart. To whomever made this cereal, Thank You.",195,,,
mende035,5,The best! So yummy!,195,,,
Christy,5,This cereal is impossible to find in Michigan. It is not too easey to find in Florida as well. I love this cereal and have not been eating any cereal since I can't find any.,195,,,

Phreakout,4,"Voice Actor Billy West was the Honey Nut Cheerios bee for many years. He also is known for Fry, Dr. Zoidberg, Hubert Farnsworth and Zap Brannigan on Futurama. Also don't forget Ren & Stimpy, Doug Funnie, Porkchop, Roger Klotz and Bugs Bunny (Space Jam).",197,,,
Jurrasic,5,"I do NOT miss the bits of nut in the cereal. I used to not buy it very often for that reason. Ever since they got rid of them, I've eaten 10x as much. The leftover milk is some of the best there is.",197,,,
TR47,2,The cereal was ruined in 2006 when they change the recipe. I refuse to buy it ever again.,197,,,
Miss The Nuts,4,I miss the little pieces of nuts that were once in this cereal but are now gone.,197,,,
larry,5,My family grew up eating Honey Nut Cheerios... my wife and I still eat it occasionally.,197,,,
rkade111,3,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal is a bit too sweet. Multigrain Cheerios are a bit too bland. I put Cheerios in my rotation occasionally, but this cereal is nothing special to me.",197,,,
Bhaal,2,"The taste is one-dimensional, like cardboard. I can understand the appeal from a nostalgia standpoint, but there are so many other better cereals out there. They don't stay a nice crunchy consistency for very long, the flavor gets old quickly while eating a bowl, and the leftover milk isn't very delicious. This cereal is much better when supplemented with additional sugar, honey or agave nectar.",197,,,
Ernie,5,Great tasting with a wide appeal; no wonder it's such a best-selling cereal!,197,,,
markuka85,4,(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal was a lot better when it actually had little nut pieces on it. Why do they change successful cereals? To save money I guess.,197,,,
MyEmptyCanvas,3,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I still sometimes, have to add a little sugar to this cereal to eat it. LOL (myemptycanvasreviews.blogspot.com)",197,,,
Kaboodle Doodle,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Instantly fell in love with this cereal when it came out. Still love it!,197,,,
Jerry GK,5,I just read in a cooking magazine that Honey Nut Cheerios is the best selling cereal in the United States. Didn't surprise me at all. I think it's the best.,197,,,
KenZ,5,"I mix together 3/4 Cup Honey Nut Cheerios, 1/2 Cup All Bran, 1 Tbsp Brown Sugar and 1 Cup Milk. WOW... Amazing breakfast.",197,,,
dev80,0,The very best cereal of all-time. It never gets boring and it helps reduce cholesterol. My very favorite.,197,,,
beebs,5,Honey Nut Cheerios are awesome! Whoever doesn't like them is probably just hatin'. Don't be hatin' on this great cereal y'all.,197,,,
Eleni,5,I love you Honey Nut Cheerios. Wish we could get you in Ireland :(,197,,,
Franny,5,Probably the greatest tasting cereal of all time. I understand how it's so high on the top 100 list.,197,,,
Connie D.,5,This is my favorite cereal! My second favorite is cinnamon toast crunch.,197,,,
Mark D.,5,I agree with the other commentators. This is the very best cereal that has ever been sold. The ultimate!,197,,,
socks,0,This is the BEST cereal ever made! Everyone should vote for it. Make Honey Nut Cheerios,197,,,
Grizzz,5,The best cereal ever made. It tastes great and fills me up. This should be number one on your list. Vote for H.N.C.!,197,,,

B.B. Please,5,Why can't we just have this cereal back already? It is too AMAZING and I seriously crave it. All other brands taste to oat-ish. Honey Nut Clusters has a distinct taste. Please... we beg... bring it back!,200,,,

Back With Nuts,5,Great cereal back in its day and way before they changed the formula eliminating the nuts. I could eat a whole box in one sitting. The formula change could be due to people with nut allergies. What if the reason why it was taken off the shelves in these later years was due to lower sales could of been for those disliking the new formula. Bring it back with the original formula and a label warning containing real nuts.,200,,,

JLo,5,"I want my honey nut clusters! I don't ever eat cereal... unless it is HNC's. Now it's not available... anyone else get that helpless feeling when venturing down the cereal aisle and knowing in your head it won't be there, but keeping that little bit of hope in your heart. It's the only cereal I'd pay almost $4 or $5 bucks for, worth every penny!! Bring it back!",200,,,
ClustersFanInMA,5,"This is my favorite cereal! I've been a fan since the original Clusters came out. The revamped version doesn't taste quite the same, but it's still my favorite. My local stores never carry it so I always buy through Amazon, but they no longer seem to carry it! It's still listed on General Mills' list of cereals, so I contacted them via their site to ask about the status regarding discontinuation as well as where to locate this cereal if they're still making/distributing it. If all the Clusters fans out there contacted them about it, maybe they'd get an idea of how beloved this cereal really is so they'd keep making it!",200,,,

So then I continue shopping and stop for a second to look at coupons, and my girlfriend goes ""Hey isn't that the cereal you're always talking about?"" I look up to see 6 boxes of Clusters sitting on some kind of random shelf that's in the side of the grocery store. I couldn't believe it. Currently enjoying my first bowl in over 5 years. Loving it! :)",200,,,
barbie962000,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I love the cereal Cheerios Clusters too! I buy 4 different kind of cheerios - I think I am leaving comments on the wrong cereal But... I guess we should not buy any General Mills cereal seeing they won't answer any one? What do you think?,200,,,
Pink Spoon,5,"On behalf of my son: he was in middle and high school and called this Squirrel Cereal. We never paid attention to the real name. When it disappeared from my store, I couldn't find it because I didn't know the darn name. Our ""Squirrel Cereal"" joke really cost us! I looked like a fool asking the clerk what happened to the Squirrel. My son is 27 now, and he has never liked any cereal better than Squirrel. Who knew that little squirrel would make such an impact on a teenager (and his mom?) I can't wait to tell him he wasn't their only customer. He was so sure he was. Amazon here we come!",200,,,
azbandit,5,This gets my vote for best cereal ever. Bring it back!,200,,,

HoneyNutLuv,5,Best cereal of all time. Me and my entire family love it. Bring it back please!,1078,,,
Timo,5,"My all time favorite cereal. They need to start selling it in Canada again. You can order it from Amazon.com, but it'll cost you at least $30 to ship it.",1078,,,
Kayden,5,"Honey Nut Cornflakes were the best cereal. Not as sweet as frosted flakes and not as plain as cornflakes. Cereals in Canada are dismal. Cookie Crisp? Kix, Rice Krispie Treats cereal? I hope some gods bring this cereal back. The new ones just don't even come close to a substitution.",1078,,,
Mr. G.,5,"It was better than regular corn flakes, better than Wheaties and even better than Honey Bunches of Oats. BRING IT BACK!",1078,,,

Yorkie Dave,5,"Yes, you can still buy it in the UK (where it was invented) it's called Crunchy Nut Cornflakes. I'm eating a bowl now.",1078,,,
Ingersoll,5,It is the best cereal. I can't find it on Ontario shelves BUT I get it all the time in Michigan and Wisconsin. In Walmart or Target. I hope it comes back to the market.,1078,,,
sunset_beach16,5,"I believe they should re-introduce this cereal back to the market. Maybe re-launch it, vamp up the packaging to make it more appealing. I believe this cereal is the best I have ever tasted, and I don't know if I can even go as far as to call it a classic, but there is no other cereal like it. I tried for years to look for a decent second best, but most cereals skimp on the nuts, thus making it unsatisfactory. I hope this company brings back the cereal, because it is a shame not to have this available to the hungry public.",1078,,,
razzamatazz,5,"I miss this cereal, very, very much. Bring back Honey Nut Corn Flakes!",1078,,,

Pearl,0,General Mills also had a cereal; and offshoot of Wheaties that was called Energy Crunch or something like that. They took it off the shelves here in Idaho. What the heck. I'm suspicious of the food industry in general. That cereal gave me so much energy I could eat it and it lasted me until supper. Maybe that's why they ended the combination of wheat and honey. I've been looking every time I go in different stores. Nobody has that combination anymore.,202,,,

PlatNuMonk,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I can still find it in lot stores, not supermarkets. I just bought several boxes as gifts.",252,,,
bubba,0,Probably discontinued because it must've been a pain to produce this cereal with two small bags of two different flavors going in one divided box. Also sounds kinda hard to pour out of the box too.,252,,,

I sure wish this be remade, or even be available to buy individually . I'd be all over it. I went to the link someone provided below, unfortunately the link didn't work anymore.

N-A,5,Bring it back. Bring it back. Also... bring it back!,252,,,
RobertPaulson,5,"Yeah, this stuff was great. It *was* a bit like Trix... I think that's the closet thing I could compare it to in straight up taste. But the consistency was better. Trix will cut the roof of your mouth into ribbons if you munch with too much gusto. Nerds had the sweetness of Trix, but with slightly more of an actual fruit taste, plus the texture that was a little softer, like maybe a giant rice crispie... God, that stuff was kiddie-crack.",252,,,
PrettyBelle,5,"It's baaack! Check this out. But it's pricey, $19.99 is a bit much. For that price it better taste the same. Very tempted to buy it, my special nerds bowl has been waiting for this cereal too (yeah I still have THE bowl).",252,,,

Jen,5,Nobody ever believed me that this cereal actually existed! I now have proof!,252,,,
Yay1982,5,"I remember eating this when I was little, so long ago but I still remember the taste and texture, well over 20 years now, it made me sad to know I would never again get to eat it, I looked for 2 years for a edible box, almost payed $60! Wish it would come back.",252,,,
Polly P.,0,It was really great. I wish it would come back so my kids could try it.,252,,,
Brandiiiiii,5,This cereal is very creative having two different sides and flavors like the actual nerd candy. They should no make that need to bring this cereal back!,252,,,
tuti,5,I wish they would come back. Nerd cereal were very good... please... please...,252,,,
Patty Whack,5,I wish it came back. Strawberry and Grape.,252,,,
Diaperdi,5,"My son ate NOTHING other than mama's milk until well after a year old. He was fat, but still within the normal range of development according to the doctor. Doctor said ""Give him food"" I responded...""He won't eat anything I try"" I discovered Nerds cereal and tried it with my son...FINALLY I found something; Anything he would eat...I wish they would bring it back...",252,,,
Kitty,4,"Description & Rating: I'm very picky and this was a cereal I loved. It has a touch of fruit or tang to it but that wasn't strong. It had a calm sweetness that stuck out but it wasn't overwhelming. It was so enjoyable, I would prefer to eat Nerds Cereal then I would Nerds. The experience of taste were alike to that of eatting a Nerd, it was sweet with a touch of tang, but not identical and perhaps reversed as Nerds have a strong tang that hits you while it was the sweetness that struck you while eatting this Cereal. I am giving it 4 out of 5 because I try to imagine it against other cereals and people's expectations. Many mascot cereals have sour marshmellows.. this leaves an impression. The box of mascot cereals are usually of a Cartoon Character or Person and their face consumes most of the box, Nerds cereal did not do this, infact it was some times hard to explain they were turely connected to the candies. With that you also lack those cuddly and collectable feelings you get when you see that family face of Mickey Mouse or Rainbow Brite calling you in. So the sum of this is Nerds Cereal had the problem of focusing more on something edible then on something you just buy because of the trend. Oh, how much I loved this cereal. I still find myself roaming the Cereal aisle talking about it. It makes for difficult trivia online,.. so even there I still speak of it. I do have to agree with Drecky. I did know some people that the Cereal did not agree with. Today I would suspect the Food Dye. I have problems explaining to people that Food Dye is not magic colors but comes from plants. I do not know if this was the cause but it's just a suggestion. If Nerds was to return, I might give it a 5/5. I would have to warn people it is like Cookie Crisp and Reese' Puff Cereal. Though it is modeled after Nerds Candy, it is a unique taste. It is also unlike any other cereal so I can not compare it's taste to any other.",252,,,
Drecky,0,"My family and I found out, when I was a kid, that we were allergic to something in the cereal...",252,,,
jenclarkson,4,"I loved the cereal, it was almost like Trix, but littler. Is it going to come back? Everything else does.... LOL",252,,,

Freddie,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  If you buy it at this link and buy a lot of boxes, the shipping will come out pretty cheap. If you buy 10 or 20 boxes at one time, the seller will probably give you free shipping. Ask him and he will tell you. It's an import. You can't find it in the US.

Monkees Lover,5,"It's back! However, it's been rebranded as 'Honey Nut Frosted Flakes' complete with Tony the Tiger on the box.",717,,,
Dianecgb,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I want them to make this cereal again! I miss it so much. I do not know why it was discontinued? This was by far the best cereal. Please, please bring it back.",717,,,
honey ivy,5,My brother and I concur with everyone here: Nut and Honey Crunch Corn Flakes are THE BEST EVER CEREAL hands down... no competition!,717,,,
geatornez82,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I've always loved the commercials for this cereal. My favorite was the one with the couple where the man is eating the cereal and the woman is playing the piano. 'He lies like a dog.',717,,,
Twee,5,I miss this cereal so much. I've tried all similar types of cereal but nothing compares.,717,,,
C.J.,5,"I frequently look for this cereal at local grocery stores but haven't seen it in several years. Many years ago on the back of the box, it featured a recipe for Tin Roof Sundae Pie. The crust was made from the cereal mixed with light corn syrup and peanut butter, then filled with ice cream and topped with chocolate covered peanuts and chocolate syrup. It is the best ice cream pie ever! I haven't been able to find a suitable substitute cereal because this particular cereal had peanuts on the flakes of cereal. Would love to make that pie again for a summertime treat!",717,,,
spiraldawn,5,"I loved this cereal. I used it as a must have ingredient for coating my oven baked chicken, pork chops, fish, etc... I really miss it.",717,,,
CB7Mom,5,"This was my favorite cereal. Absolutely nothing tastes as good. Why was it removed from the grocery store shelves? Who makes these decisions, anyway? What kind of market research was done to render its removal? Come on! Reconsider and please produce this cereal, once again.",717,,,
Soog,5,This gets my vote for the very best cereal ever!,717,,,
Jeez,5,This was the only cereal I would buy and eat. Really miss it. Have not seen Honey Nut Crunch.,717,,,
Missing Nut,5,"Why, why WHY was this great cereal discontinued? Is there anywhere I can buy it?",717,,,
Dean,5,"When I was a kid, I used to eat this every Saturday morning while watching cartoons. The commercial (aimed at kids) would always come while I was eating, it seemed. I always thought that was cool.",717,,,
Shawanda,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I like the new Crunchy Nut cereal but it is nothing like the old brand. I guess the ingredients have changed.,717,,,
finallyfoundit,0,Oh thank goodness for new Crunchy Nut. I LOVE this cereal. It's pretty much the same.,717,,,
Tom6,5,The best tasting cereal of all time. What doofus decided to change it? Must work for Coke now.,717,,,
Calilove82,5,I used to love this cereal as a child and I have not seen it in a while. I still have been looking for it over the years and even told my husband about it who had no clue what I was talking about. I have tried different types as a variation and none ever came close. I am glad I found an alternative thanks to you.,717,,,
Jawz,5,I pretty much agree with every comment up here and I am going to have to look for Crunchy Nut.,717,,,
K.G.3.,5,Best cereal ever!,717,,,
moresa,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This was the best cereal. I was very disappointed when I could not find it anymore. I looked for this cereal for more than a year every time I went to any store. Now I have it again in the form of Honey Nut Crunch. You have never seen a grown woman get so happy When I saw the commercial I ran out and bought 4 boxes. It is the best cereal I have ever eaten. Do not ever stop making it again.,717,,,
TwoPynts,4,(Team Breakfast Member)  I have fond memories of eating this in the 80s. I'm glad they brought it back under a new name.,717,,,
dana41231,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Yep, just bought some Kellogg's Crunchy Nut. It's good but not as good as I remember.",717,,,
jaebello1,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  They make a newer version now called Kellogg's Crunchy Nut!!,717,,,
heidi,0,"They now have a ""Crunchy Nut"" cereal that is the same I think.",717,,,
WoWGal79,5,This cereal was sooooooo good - wish they still made it!,717,,,
tonto,5,The commercials for this cereal were actually very funny!,717,,,

Ellen,5,"Oatbake was not only a great breakfast cereal option, but I most often would eat it as a satisfying snack. I wish Kellogg's would reintroduce it to today's health minded society.",256,,,
par4jets,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Unequivocally the best cereal ever made. I used to order it by the case from our grocer as it's distribution began to taper. Very disappointed to see it go but grateful to have enjoyed it so much!,256,,,
Kaley,5,One of my all-time favorites.,256,,,
Rin3guy,5,"I just got off the phone with Kellogg's, begging them to bring back Oatbake. YES, I agree, best cereal ever!",256,,,
Montana L.B.,5,All about the taste... one of the best ever! I would LOVE to see Kellogg's bring it back!,256,,,
CerealCrusher,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) Is there a parallel these days, with maybe a little less excessive caloric punch as found in Cracklin' Oat Bran?",256,,,

SherryHarper,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Omg, how I miss my Oatbake Cereal! With it, I never needed Linzess or Milk of Magnesia! The taste was the most astounding of any cereal ever!",256,,,
Bama Cereal Man,5,"Best cereal ever, nothing even compares. I have written Kellogg's a few times over the years, just hoping they may bring this cereal back. Each time they suggest Cracklin' Oat Bran, which is not as good (tastes like cardboard). Just today, I bought a box of Baked Oat Bites by Natures Valley. It was pretty good, but still a bit too sweet.",256,,,
Sad20Years,5,My all-time favorite cereal and I have not been able to have it in twenty years! I really wish they would bring it back!,256,,,
grack,5,"I agree that this was the best cereal ever. It was out at the same time as Cracklin' Oat Bran and it was much better. My guess is Kellogg's put their money on Cracklin' Oat Bran because it had slightly less fat and thus could be touted as a ""health"" cereal. It's a shame because they are both sugar/fiber cereals, but Oatbake was the tasty one...!",256,,,
Scrummy,5,"Healthy, tasty, crunchy and full of fiber. Scrumptious with milk or as a healthy snack/alternative to sweets. Never goes soggy. One of only 2 cereals I love so please bring it back.",256,,,

R.S.D.A.,5,Isn't this Craklin' Oat Bran now? I thought they just changed the name.,256,,,
Mr. Oatbake,5,What is wrong with the Kellogg's Co. Don't they know that Oatbake was the best tasting cereal ever. Is was like eating chewy oatmeal raisin cookies. Bring it back!,256,,,
Mosher2,0,It would really make-a-you move. Good fiber.,256,,,
J.R.S.,5,"If they bring it back, I will definitely buy lots of it! When I was 19, I worked in a grocery store... if I ate this cereal everyday it kept me regular. Lol. Which even at age 19 I knew that was a good thing. Why did they discontinue this great tasting cereal?",256,,,
Erin-k-s:),5,"This was, by far, the best cereal ever made... healthy, filling, and great tasting (years later I still remember its delicious flavor!). If there ever was a cereal to be brought back from cereal heaven, this should be the one!",256,,,
Coats,5,20 plus years after I had my last bowl of Oatbake I'm still looking for it to return to production... that's how good it was.,256,,,
Neese,5,My family loved this cereal and ate it all the time. Why was it removed from the stores. Please bring this cereal back.,256,,,

daytona,5,I would give anything for Oatbake to be on the market again.,256,,,
bake4me,5,"Yeah, the honey bake was my favorite of all time cereal.",256,,,
Auntie,4,My kids and I loved this cereal. The raisins or dates really added to the taste. The kids would eat it right out of the box for anacks. Please bring it back.,256,,,
Gates,5,"I loved Oatbake. I wish they'd bring it back, too.",256,,,
Honey Buns,0,"I miss this cereal, it was the greatest ever. I contacted Kellogg's & asked them to bring it back.",256,,,
R&amp;C,4,"Years ago, my wife & I would buy an Oatbake cereal. We are not sure which company made it. We have looked for it for years but have not found it on any store shelf.

nostalgia fan,5,"Yes, I say a re-release. Best Cereal ever. I remember buying 3 boxes, and my routine was come home from work at 9pm and eat 2 bowls of OJ cereal!",264,,,
ZodWallop,3,"Even as a kid, I remembered thinking the combination of oranges and breakfast cereal was weird. The cereal was okay. But I really remember those commercials. The ad agency knocked it out of the park on that one.",264,,,
pinkbobbie1,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Loved it.,264,,,
The Ritty,0,I remember the commercials. Never had it. I always wanted to just taste it though lol.,264,,,
O.J. Frank,5,Please bring back OJ's Cereal! Best cereal ever! Gone way too soon.,264,,,
Z.Z. Bottom,5,"I want this one back. Last time I had it, I was 5 years old. Miss it.",264,,,
Crunch N.,5,They have to bring back OJs. I can remember it like I was just eating it yesterday. Cereals today are junk. We need this one back.,264,,,
seti73,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Loved it... bring it back! Nothing else tastes anything like it.,264,,,
Chevy58,5,I love this cereal as well. I was wondering what ever happened to it. What a shame it disappeared.,264,,,
Dagel7,5,I loved this cereal when I was a kid. I wouldn't mind if they brought it back so I can show and share it with my boys now.,264,,,
axe,5,I absolutely loved this cereal as a kid and remember not being able to find it anymore. A sad day.,264,,,
Bucksky11,0,This is probably the cereal I never had that I most want to try. What I wouldn't give to be able to go back in time and walk down cereal aisles in the late seventies or early to mid eighties!,264,,,
Mimi,5,Please bring this cereal back! There's no orange-flavored cereal on the market now. I bet people would try it just because it's different.,264,,,
Jeff-2,5,I loved this cereal as a kid. The combo of the orange cereal and the milk tasted like a Dreamsicle.,264,,,
Mike D.-JAX,5,"I loved this cereal as a kid! I'm 35 and still remember it. Wish Kellogg's would bring it back, if only for a short run again.",264,,,
Colecovisionary,5,"This cereal was great - as if you took all the orange flavored Froot Loops out of a box and put them in one bowl. Delicious. It's too bad that Froot Loops now taste like garbage since they're no longer covered with sugar crystals but ARE loaded with fiber. Yuk! Even if they started making O.J.'s again, it would taste like nasty cereal from now instead of sugary goodness from back then.",264,,,
limesparks,2,Something about orange juice and milk never worked for me...,264,,,
AA6,4,Talk about memories! I've had this cereal. It was pretty good. Too bad they stopped making it.,264,,,
securityboi81,5,I miss this cereal!! Bring it back!!,264,,,
Ageless Kid,0,"The commercial for this cereal was a take off on the opening for the classic CBS western ""RAWHIDE"".",264,,,
Checkerman,4,"The commercial had OJ Joe herding his Orange ""cattle"" lassoing, them, and branding them with the OJ branding iron he holds in his hand.",264,,,

JimBo,5,Better than Cherrios. Please bring it back.,263,,,
Chompchomp,3,"I really remember this cereal. My mom bought it several times. To me, the taste was similar to Cheerios but Yogi on the box was really special. I do remember when my mom said it wasn't at the store any more and I was disappointed, it probably was around 1963 when I was 4 years old.",263,,,
bambam472001,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I remember OK cereal and really enjoyed eating it. I also snacked on OK cereal without milk. Would really like to see this cereal come back. I miss eating this cereal and have been remembering the taste, which I always thought was better than the other brand.",263,,,
Big Tyrone,5,"They were my favorite cereal, they were much better than Cheerios.",263,,,
Tracey1960,5,"Please Kellogg's bring back OKs!?! They were my one and only cereal as a kid (born in 1960) I used to eat them as a snack too, straight from the box, dry with no milk. I have no memory of who was the 'Mascot' on the box and if this is shocking to admit, I don't really care! To this day I don't like breakfast cereals, but if OKs were released back on the market, I would be first through the door to buy them! Please, please, please Kellogg's, bring back OKs, the best cereal ever!",263,,,
nutrition3Cs,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Pretty sure I was able to find OKs into the very early 70s when I was shopping on my own. My recollection is that they were a bit more solid than Cheerios and definitely had a distinctive flavor. My favorite cereal ever.,263,,,
Robert,0,I hadn't thought of OK's for decades until I just purchased a box of Millville Chrispy Oats from Aldi. The taste was distinctly different from Cheerios as they usually taste and immediately brought OK's to mind. Thinking first of the Scottish guy before even remembering the name. What is that taste?,263,,,
Fundy,4,Hal Baylor was 'Big Otis' in their 1959-1960 commercials.,263,,,
Harper,3,I remember a cut-out castle on the box that may have wrapped around the sides to utilize the box bottom as a stand. This was during the Big Otis period.,263,,,
ScaryGuy,3,I remember this as a little kid. I would never let my mom buy this cereal. Big Otis scared the heck outta me.,263,,,
Albeback,5,My favorite. It was available in Australia until about 1970.,263,,,
No Nickname,0,"@5PM: I agree... I was born in 1959, and I remember OKs from the mid-sixties. It's a mistake to say the cereal was discontinued in 1962, because I've seen pictures of a box from 1967. I remember they were like Cheerios, and yet had a distinctive taste. Too bad they stopped making them.",263,,,
Duane,5,I miss it and wish I could still buy it.,263,,,
5PM,5,OKs were better than Cheerios to me; they were certainly being sold later than 1962 as I wouldn't be able to remember them otherwise.,263,,,
Phil Z.,1,"My memory is that this was a pretty bad cereal. I doubt I tried it twice. This was back when Otis was the mascot. Strangely, I liked Cheerios back then though.",263,,,
Cypress,5,I think that if OKs were reintroduced it would be successful because basically there is a whole new group of people out there who would discover it.,263,,,
Yumarama,3,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I have no recollection of Otis on this cereal, although I very much recall Yogi and Boo Boo being featured. I remember they had cut-out faces on the back that you could wear as a mask. Although this cereal made an appearance in our house now and again, it never became a staple and disappeared rather quickly; from reading the info above, I now see it was due to Kellogg's inability to outseat Cheerios' market lead.",263,,,
jdharr,0,Oops. My previous comment stated that O.K. Berry was then president of Kellogg's . He was actually Senior Vice President of Sales for Kellogg's. This is the link to his Obituary. Rest in peace Mr. Berry.,263,,,
jdharr,0,"OK cereal was named after ""O""tis ""K""enneth Berry, the then president of Kellogg's . O.K. Berry is what we all knew him as. I first met O.K. Berry when I was 13 years old . He was retired then and summered at his large farm in Litchfield ,Maine. And to the ""Cincinnati Kid"", Otis was a small man, and far from being a pro wrestler.",263,,,
Captjay,5,Loved them as a kid! Bring them back! OKs were better than okay. They were the BEST.,263,,,
MJ6,5,I agree with,263,,,
hopefull,5,"They had a much better toasted oat taste than others and I would very much like them reintroduced. Cheerios get mushy too fast and are weak in oat taste. OKs were much better. A consumer test is in order. OKs will win. I still remember the smell, taste and crunch. Let's get to it and do something about this. PLEASE!",263,,,
G.S. Boomer,5,PLEASE consider bringing back OKs. I am not the only Boomer who loved this cereal!,263,,,
Rodney61,5,"Here in Australia, Kellogg's kept making them locally until the early 70's. Forty years on and I call them my all-time favorite.",263,,,
Dolton Boy,3,"They were okay. Can't see why they dumped a brawny Scottish Highland warrior trying to sell something because ""it was good for you"" to us baby-boomers for a fun-loving cartoon bear... I send in and got the skin-diver prize.",263,,,
BooBooPicnic,0,I am trying to remember which cereal it was that my mom ordered for me. It had a Yogi bear type head piece that was made from paper I am sure and it fit over your head and had holes where the eyes were so that you could see out. Just going down memory lane and would like to see a picture of this if possible.,263,,,
Cincinnati Kid,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) I thought this cereal came out the year before - 1958. Seem to recall it in the late summer of that year. I wonder who played the part of ""Big Otis"" in the TV commercials? Maybe an unemployed pro wrestler? I'm unable to rate this cereal, I never tasted it.",263,,,
jjw,5,Bring them back!,263,,,
Ai A. Bama,0,I do remember Yogi Bear on the OK's box. I guess it was because that Kellogg's was the sponsor for the Yogi Bear and 2 other Hanna Barberra shows.,263,,,
Heddy,0,That guy looks like you Mister Breakfast - if u had a beard and mustache and were a little bigger and were from Scotland. Never tried the cereal. Looks good. Like your site.,263,,,

jmroszczak,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal was seriously the best... but when I grew up it didn't have those nasty dried marshmallows that the one made in South Korea has today. I remember when I was 14 in 1999 - I had to live in the country for the summer at our cottage where there was nothing to do... and this cereal gave me a reason to get up in the morning. BRING IT BACK!,270,,,
mil222,0,"This was everyone's favorite cereal as a kid, but thanks a lot to Post who discontinued it in 2007. If only they brought them back one more time in the U.S. - But still a great Cereal.",270,,,

Shelly,5,I miss this cereal so much! I have been craving this cereal forever. It NEEDS to come BACK!,270,,,
Bhaal,5,"Delicious. I just received 2 boxes from Korea as a gift after not having it for 8+ years. It's just as delicious as I remembered. Nice and crunchy, rich chocolate and cream taste. The only negative is it doesn't make as delicious milk as some of my other favorite cereals. Milk aside however, this is probably the best cereal created.",270,,,
kaytlynn,5,They should start selling this in the states again. This was an amazing cereal.,270,,,
LadyB,5,"If the cereal comes back to the market, please also bring it back to Canada! It was the best chocolate cereal on the market. Not too sweet referring to the original of course! Two thumbs up!",270,,,

MyEmptyCanvas,1,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I hated this cereal (the original without marshmallows!). It didn't really taste chocolaty. It reminded me of cheap cheerios with a hint of what was to be chocolate, but somehow was not. If Post could've figured out a way to make it actually taste like Oreo cookies though -- WOW what a difference in ratings I'd give for this. (myemptycanvasreviews.blogspot.com)",270,,,

dabesteva,5,"I want Oreo O's! What happened to them? For those who long to eat them... Buy the Flintstones Marshmallow pebbles cereal. It is not as good, but hey, there are MARSHMALLOWS! Lol.

kevychevy,5,"Whats wrong with this country, other than we keep puting all these crooks in office that keep giving all our manufacturing jobs away (and I mean all of them DEM and REP) and is causing this country to go broke? Manufacturing is what made this country so great and is also what made up most of the middle class in AMERICA. Now look at us. We can't even make a cereal that was the best tasting thing to ever enter my body. 80% of everything that is made now is made in CHINA and I think in the next 20 to 30 years that country will over take us in being the greatest country on the planet. Bring back Oreo-Os and bring back America!",270,,,
Vik,5,Bring back Oreo O's please. At least give an alternative homemade version?,270,,,

D,5,OMG! PLEASE start making this cereal again. It's been years & I can still taste it. NO OTHER CEREAL compares to this childhood memory. My father loves this cereal too & would love to be able to sit down and eat one or a million more bowls with me just like we use to when I was a child. Favorite memory of me & my Pops eating this together for breakfast & many times as a snack.,259,,,
N.D.,5,Fortified Oat Flakes is my all time favorite. It had a delicious flavor. I hope that you will start making it again.,259,,,
bronzebeauty,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I love this cereal, need a box today. Best tasting cereal in the Post Cereal history. Bring it back please, even if limited time.",259,,,
A Very Old Fan,4,"When I was younger I really enjoyed your Post Oak Flakes. Then I could not find them in my local stores. Do you still make them, if so, where can buy post Oak Flakes now. A very old fan",259,,,
ocie,5,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cereal!!!!!!! But I can not find it in any store where I live. Is it still being made????? If so please let me know what stores sell it. Thank you - Ocie Ravetto (Ocie1@att.net)",259,,,
Oat Flaker,5,"The original Post Oat Flakes was by far the best tasting cereal ever. In the mid 1960's, Post tinkered with the recipe to get a product that would not get soggy in milk, calling it Fortified Oat Flakes. These were good, but far inferior in taste to the original recipe. Post Oat Flakes with cream were really good.",259,,,

Manny,5,"I cannot find this cereal or Oatmeal Raisin Crisp at any of my local grocery stores. There was one but it is either out or, since it is far away, it is rare that I can get there and must buy several boxes.",725,,,
Enough Already,0,I'm sick of the commercial on the internet. Can't they come up with something that makes sense?,725,,,
Humour,5,Commercial is great. Best one I've seen in ages. Get a sense of humor people and recognize it's a commercial and not meant to be taken so seriously. I swear people nowadays just don't have enough to worry about that they would react against this ad. It's one of my all time favorites and my children (all 4 of them) love it too and have not been mentally harmed because of it!,725,,,
ynos,5,"Lighten Up! In the commercial, he wasn't beating the heck out of them, calling them fat, or locking them in the garage with the car on. It was a funny way of depicting how good a product is, with the target audience being the younger demographic. I'm just going to take a stab at it and say that all of you people who call this commercial ""horrible"" defend hoarders, and call it a ""mental issue"". They're LAZY. That's a real issue. This is just plain comical.",725,,,
Lacy15,5,"Wow, grownups need to lighten up. It's just a cute commercial. Kids know it's not serious. It's not the greatest commercial, but it's really not that offensive. - Lacy",725,,,
tinylibra,1,"I liked this cereal but will not buy it as long as its message says that it's OK to reject kid for a BOWL OF CEREAL! Does General Mills read what we write. Does it in any way count. If it does, they will remove this unacceptable ad.",725,,,
doctor,0,So many children go to school hungry or skip breakfast AND the unfunny commercial for this cereal that has been airing for a long time does NOTHING to demonstrate that children NEED a breakfast.,725,,,
Abe Simpson,0,I am pleased to see that there other people who find this a negative commercial which sets a poor example for children that basically it's okay to be selfish and greedy. It is not clever advertising - rather the opposite. I have a good sense of humour and am open-minded but surely a company of the magnitude of General Mills can do better than this.,725,,,
discussed paren,0,The commercial with the kids and their dad in a car is the most disgusting commercial I have ever watched. It shows people how not to treat their children and should be removed from TV.,725,,,
stillreal,4,"Saw this commercial again this morning Jan 2012. Seem abusing and lying to children is fine or is this considered just bad judgement in teasing. Really good lesson for kids to learn, if you run the risk of your kids eating your cereal, don't let them have it. Come on guys, ditch this pathetic ad.",725,,,
gusterson,4,"Great commercial. Based on comments, it seems even the ones who didn't like the commercial remembered it. I'm sure the kids thought it was funny, and probably asked for the cereal. C'mon folks lighten up!",725,,,
Baldeagle,0,"The current commercial for this cereal portrays men in a negative way and I resent it. It shows men as, untrustworthy, dishonest, and the commercial is just plain stupid. Please take it off the air.",725,,,
hostile,0,I hate that horrible TV ad regarding the dad eating cereal in the car. It is parental abuse. I will not buy the cereal as long as it is on the air. - G. Walsh,725,,,
carrothead,0,"How old is that commercial? The young girl looks like Charlotte Church, the singer; she's all grown up now with children of her own.",725,,,
boatman1,0,Well I am glad that I a not the only one with the observation that this TV add gives off a negative Message. How do you suppose we teach our children to share and then we get these message. Hope that the once responsible get the MESSAGE!!!,725,,,
disappointed,0,I no longer buy this cereal and others made by General Mills because of the commercial showing the father locking the car so that his children can't get in. Children are taught to share and this is a bad example. Little ones do not know that this is only a commercial.,725,,,
dadincareating,5,"HAHAHAHA!!!!! I love the commercial of the dad in the car. Kids are spoiled snot-nosed punks anyways, let the dad have his time alone in peace. VERY UPLIFTING!!!!!",725,,,
Ollie,0,"Your ad during the news in the evenings with the man ""locking"" the car so his two children don't get any cereal is pathetic. The children walk away disgusted as this grown man locks his windows and feasts on this cereal. I will never buy it because of your ads that children are watching. Shame on you!! Olive Grunert St. John's Nfld.",725,,,
M.M.O.M.,0,"No matter what the reviews say I would not buy this cereal because of the TV add. It shows self centeredness, inability to share, poor parent model and gluttony.",725,,,
t.g.f.,5,This is my favorite cereal!,725,,,
Ami,0,Please remove that terrible ad on TV regarding the dad eating cereal in the car and not letting his children in and locking the door. It's a Dad abusing his children. I'm sure you could get a much better ad for your cereal and more uplifting. - A. Wetzl,725,,,
ron,5,Oatmeal crisp makes my mornings fun and energized!!,725,,,

j3px1,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Ever peel yourself away from your project work just long enough to get those 'grab it and go' foods, wolf it, and get right back to work? Lately it's been dry foods for me. As a plain yogurt 'connoisseur', I've put every cereal from Reese's Puffs to MiniWheats into it. I just fell in yum! with Oops! All Berries! in my Yogurt. I put 2 cups of Oops! All Berries at the bottom and 4 big dollops of yogurt on top. The fruity taste from the berries cereal gets into the yogurt. And the YYYYYYYYYYum!!! taste... is like a 'dry' Jamba Juice smoothie. The next time you're in a store, and if the food is cheap enough, I recommend trying this.",674,,,
Leroy,5,"Sad, but they used my idea and didn't give me any credit. I loved Cap'n Crunch with crunch berries. So much so that I wrote the company and suggested that they come out with a cereal called ""ALL Berries"", with just crunch berries. They wrote me back and said that it wouldn't be possible for them to produce ""all berries"" because of the cost. Several years later, I was in the local grocery store in Killeen, Texas called HEB. I was startled when I looked on the shelf and saw the box ""Oops, All Berries"". Needless to say I was pretty upset. I've made many suggestions to companies and I can live with the standard denial letter, but they were wrong!",674,,,

Miss K.,5,This is seriously my favorite cereal ever. But I can't find it anywhere! Not even Amazon!,276,,,
cranklin,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Sign the petition to bring it back! https://www.change.org/p/general-mills-general-mills-to-bring-back-peanut-butter-toast-crunch,276,,,
Toast Master,5,General Mills - Please bring this cereal back! You could do it as a special promotion for a limited period of time. I believe Quaker Oats does this for Quisp Cereal.,276,,,
Patty G.,5,Please bring this cereal back. I really love this cereal!,276,,,
Sailor_Sega,5,One of the best American cereals I have ever tasted. I hope they bring it back.,276,,,
Bonnie,5,I absolutely LOVE this cereal! Please bring it back! I can't find it anymore. Will they be bringing it back?,276,,,
Sabs3,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  How do I buy it? I can't find it in stores anymore.,276,,,
Ernie,4,I found the Peanut Butter flavor not too overpowering. This is certainly a less sweet version of the regular Cinnamon Toast Crunch.,276,,,
grain190,4,I love this cereal! Mix it with some Cocoa Pebbles and it's the best stuff ever!,276,,,
monster,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This is the best cereal ever, but our Walmart keeps running out of it and we have to go to other counties to find it. Please see if you can keep it in our store. It is worth the ride tho!",276,,,
J.A. 6,5,The peanut butter flavor is so good! Don't ever take it away!,276,,,

WalderC,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Yeah! My favorite cereal is finally back! Please let it be here to stay this time because I don't want to go through having it taken away like the last time again.,276,,,
Rager,2,"It's lacking the crunch I hoped it would have... after all it does have the word crunch in the name. As for taste, it really does taste like peanut butter and it's believable that there really is peanut butter in the recipe because of its lack of crunch. It seems flat as if the air has been let out. Kind of bummed. This will definitely be my last purchase of it. I still love the cinnamon flavor the very best!",276,,,
DrJackstraw,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This is absolutely THE BEST peanut butter-flavored cereal ever made. General Mills had the good sense to bring it back - let's hope it's here to stay.,276,,,
Red23,5,"I first saw and tried this cereal last month and I love it! I love peanut butter and used to eat the Captain Crunch peanut butter cereal, but this takes the cake. It tastes just like peanut butter. The only problem that I have with it is that it's addicting and I was eating it like 2 times a day, haha. I'm all out, but I'm going to get more today. They have it at Publix everybody!",276,,,
mitch079,5,Saw it in Kroger today. Glad I bought a box.,276,,,

AAG,5,I loved this cereal and hope it comes back some day. It might make me actually want to eat breakfast again.,276,,,
Kenny B.,5,Please bring back Peanut Butter Toast Crunch cereal. I agree with all the other people that wrote comments here. It was amazing. Gone way too soon. Thanks.,276,,,
Tyler,5,"OMG please... I woke up this morning Jonesing so hard for this cereal... I actually picked up my tablet and began searching the internet for possibly the last box on earth, and that somehow I would be able to order it online. Hear my plea for this. This is my favorite cereal in the world.",276,,,
Me-Me,5,Please bring them back! I will buy every box off the shelf.,276,,,
cerealfanatic,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I had forgotten this cereal even existed until about 10 seconds ago... but now that I remember it, I can recall how amazing it was! This cereal was probably the best peanut butter cereal I've ever had. It soaked up the milk to obtain a certain level of moisture that actually gave the cereal a creamy texture very similar to real peanut butter. It was honestly one of the best cereals I've ever had, I can't believe I forgot about it.",276,,,
Ace,5,Please bring this cereal back! I miss its so much you wouldn't believe it.,276,,,
star,5,"Please bring this cereal back! It was the greatest peanut butter cereal! The new peanut butter Cheerios is okay, but this one was great.",276,,,
t.t.,5,This was the best peanut butter cereal I've ever had and one of the best cereals altogether.,276,,,
A Customer,5,Why in the name of all that is sacred did they discontinue the greatest cereal of all time! I would swear off all other cereal if they would only bring this product back for the thousands (if not millions) that adore it!!!,276,,,
peanut kid,5,I loved Peanut Butter Toast Crunch. It's may all-time favorite cereal. Please bring it back.,276,,,
april75,5,I never liked cereal until I had Peanut Butter Toast Crunch! I hope it comes back!,276,,,
Jenna,5,This was the best cereal. I hope it comes back! I was trying to find it online to order it... I want it!,276,,,
da kang,5,"I have never had this cereal before and yet after talking with my wife and reading all 30+ comments, I am afraid that General Mills is going to have to bring this back. Thank you.",276,,,
JENNI,5,This was the best cereal ever! I miss it so much! I miss the crunch!,276,,,

satmorncereal,5,I will buy a box a week if you bring it back!,276,,,
Chris F.,5,"For the Love of God, please bring this cereal back!",276,,,
LauraC,5,"This is THE BEST cereal I've ever had!! Sometimes I'd combine it with Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I was VERY disappointed when it was discontinued. I even contacted General Mills and they said that it lacked sales. I don't see how that's possible since I bought it often!! PLEASE, bring it back!!!",276,,,
tdawg,5,Please bring it back!,276,,,
tootsweet,5,Why stop making the best snack cereal of all time?,276,,,

Central Mass,5,Where can I find Pettijohn cereal in Massachusetts. I had it when I was young. It was the best.,1173,,,
olddozerguy,0,This cereal was made by some of my ancestors.,1173,,,
Lobbster,5,I remember this when I was a kid!,1173,,,
Glo,5,"Pettijohn cereal is a favorite flavor (comfort food) memory from childhood. Have looked for it in many stores over many years. I too, would love for Quaker to return it to grocery shelves - or even for purchase online! It fits right in with all the health food emphasis, but tastes better!",1173,,,
Patti Erickson,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Have searched many states where we have lived (married 58 years Dec.28) for my favorite childhood cereal - Pettijohn's! Lived growing-up years in North Dakota and Pettijohn's carried me throughout a school day. Loved the translucent look of the flakes. No other cereal is like it, feel I have tried ALL the cooked type to duplicate it, nope, it is a jewel, one-of-a-kind. Want it again!",1173,,,
Prince,0,My siblings and I were together this past week and we had fond memories of Pettijohn.,1173,,,
19don36,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I remember my Mom preparing this for breakfast when I was a boy. It was delicious and a step above oatmeal in my mind. I used to beg when we went to the store, ""Please get some PettiJohn's""! I am now just short of 80 and would buy a case if I could get it! Please bring it back for us oldsters.",1173,,,
Lizawren,5,"My grandmother fed me this cereal for breakfast and I loved it. Please, Quaker, bring it back!",1173,,,
Lorilea,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  My Great-Grandfather was Eli Pettijohn. I remember my dad talking about Grandfather Eli testing out new recipes on the family. Such a great part of our family history!,1173,,,
Samalam,4,"Well, I enjoy oatmeal greatly, however Mom DeVeau says Pettijohn's is the best. All I can say as of this day is I can not compare. For mom's word about today's food, go Pettijohn's.",1173,,,
Penny Ark,5,"I ate Pettijohn's cereal in the hospital cafeteria (in Denver, Colorado) I used to work in back in the 70s. My mother and I have both looked for it and like everyone else have been unable to find it. We would also like to see it come back.",1173,,,
Shaman,5,I remember my grandmother making this hot cereal and really liking it. The image of the bear always stayed with me... have looked for this product in many stores with no luck... guess it has faded into the sunset like those Sunshine Raisin Cookies we also used to eat as kids.,1173,,,
xmas carol,5,I have been looking for this cereal. I had eaten it many years ago and it is the only cooked wheat cereal I ever found that had that wonderful flavor of a cereal my mom cooked when I was a child. This old cereal was a grain home grown and given to us by a farmer and my dad had to grind it with a hand grinder he owned. My mother then cooked it for a breakfast cereal. I have searched for the name of that home grown wheat and have never found it but I would be satisfied once again if I could buy Pettijohns again and enjoy it in that form. The flavor was out of this world.,1173,,,
misspettijohn,5,"It would be wonderful if Quaker would re-introduce Pettijohn's. It was a great way to start the day especially those cold winter mornings in Iowa. There's a whole generation of potential customers that have never tasted this cereal. Quaker is missing a terrific marketing opportunity. Personally, I can't stand oatmeal. It's too much like wallpaper paste.",1173,,,
Seeking PJ,5,I have been searching for this cereal since I had it in the hospital years ago and have not been able to locate it until now. I would like to know how to purchase some.,1173,,,

Lindsay,0,This is my great uncle Eli's breakfast cereal. - Lindsay Pettijohn,1173,,,
Hot Memories,5,I always liked Quaker Oats oatmeal; but Pettijohn's was just as good and very nutritious. I never felt hungry mid-morning; it stuck with me until lunchtime.,1173,,,
G-MAN,5,I agree with all the other comments. It was the best hot cereal ever! Zoom was also good.,1173,,,
Myles,5,I fondly remember eating Pettijohn cereal as a young boy whenever I visited my dear aunt Gerri in the 1950's. It was so good. I could never get enough of the stuff. I have looked for it for years and was surprised to discover so many others have the same recollection of this wonderful product. It would be great to be able to enjoy this cereal again.,1173,,,
Cheryl C.,5,I ate Pettijohn's a child in the late 1950's. It was a delicious form of oatmeal - but better! Someone please bring it back. Smile! - Cheryl Cole,1173,,,
Monte,5,It was a delicious and nutritious hot cereal. I wish Quaker would make it again for everyone to enjoy.,1173,,,
Nicole K.,5,I have been looking for the Pettijohn's Brand of Rolled Barley cereal for years. I remember my grandma making it for breakfast in the late 60's & early 70's.,1173,,,
Bob CY,0,"One of my favorite boyhood memories while visiting my grandparents in Sharon springs, NY was savoring delicious Pettijohns each morning. Of course real maple syrup helped! - Carl Yettru",1173,,,
Cindy,0,"I was looking up ""grits"" to find out whether it's a singular or plural noun, which got me wondering about Pettijohns. We served it for breakfast at my alma mater, Stephens College in Columbia, MO. Didn't know ""Pettijohns"" was a brand name until today! Thank goodness for the Web (sometimes...).",1173,,,
dobber,5,I have never found any cereal to compare with Pettijohns. I am 92 years old and my mother served it often when I was a child.,1173,,,

Pete,5,"I loved this cereal, please if it is still available post it on this site. I am in my 80's and would love to have it again.",1173,,,
cereal man,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I ate this cereal as a boy, and later in life if I could find it on the grocers shelf. The last I remember buying it was in the 1980's. Could this cereal be found now? Possibly under another name or sold buy another vender? timothy.dahlberg@gmail.com Wisconsin.",1173,,,
Cricket,5,"I LOVED this cereal as a child back in the 50's! By the time I was a mom, I could no longer find it anywhere... is it still made or not? It definitely SHOULD be!",1173,,,
Ray J.,5,"My family found Pettijohns about 1954. We could no find it after about 1960. We have looked for it for years. Is it still available, and where, in Ventura County California. Tatefully, Ray Johnson - Ojai, California",1173,,,
Milwaukee D.,5,I wish it were still available to introduce to my grandchildren. Growing up in Milwaukee it kept me warm on many a cold morning. One of the all-time best foods ever. Great texture and flavor.,1173,,,
pettijohn,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) My grandparents in Beatrice, Nebraska served this every morning. They fixed it in a double boiler, and then we added the condiments... brown sugar, half and half, and toppings of choice! I remember thinking it was the best breakfast ever. As a girl, traveling to see them was our ""road trip"" for the year! I awoke to them visiting with each other as they prepared the delicious hot cereal for our family. Priceless!",1173,,,
Dow,5,"This was my favorite cereal as a little girl in the 1930s; I called it ""bear cereal"" because of the picture on the box. One of my favorite stories was ""The Three Bears.""",1173,,,
bfast-yeah,5,"If this is the same stuff my Mom fed to me when I was a wee pup, it's slammin'! Yum yum yum!!",1173,,,

Eddie C,5,'Pink Panther Flakes are pink & sweet... As you can tell the color of pink... Tickles me pink!' Other premiums were a pink invisible ink pen & revealing marker and a notepad of Panther paper that dissolved in water. Neat thing was how only the Panther's eye would remain floating! Always wondered if that was planned or a happy accident.,278,,,
SpaceBarron,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Still in my all time top 10 favorites! The Pink Panther will always be COOL.,278,,,
joliv109,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Why did they ever discontinue this cereal!? They should bring it back for one day!,278,,,

JefferyK,5,I LOVED this cereal! It turned the milk pink! And I have vivid memories of playing with the RPX car advertised on the back cover.,278,,,
loyaltubist,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This wasn't strawberry flavored. It was simply pink colored frosted flakes. I loved them. But I also like pink.,278,,,
KixRulez,4,"RE: Yhe inaudible part of the jingle - It always drove me nuts as a kid because it didn't make sense, but listening it to again I hear this: ""Pink Panther flakes / are pink / and sweet as you / Pink Pan / the color of pink / tickles me pink."" Still doesn't make sense, but I think I got it at least!",278,,,
Rochellesc,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Loved the show, the cereal, the theme song, but most if all, the awesome prizes inside! The one I remember most is the little zip car. Too bad we know today that most sweetened cereals are on par with candy fortified with vitamins. :(. The last quarter of the 20th century was a great time to be a kid!",278,,,
Acoldstream,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was my all time favorite cereal EVER. It had such a great taste and it did not taste like today's Frosted Flakes, it was da bomb! The color did come off quickly and it was HEAVEN!",278,,,
E. J. Donald,5,I loved the Pink Panther Flakes and I also had the spy kit... was my favorite toy for a whole summer. I wish they still made the cereal and I wish I still had the spy kit. Thanks for the memories cereal guy!,278,,,

vinman1981,5,Why can't they bring Pink Panther Flakes back... just for a limited time... whatever. Bring it back!,278,,,
Lyndon,0,I had an unopened box of Pink Panther Flakes in our garage from '74 through '86. And then we had water damage and it got soaked. I'm still heartbroken about it.,278,,,
magicflute,5,"I'm trying to get one of the Pink Panther Spy Kits that you have in the pictures. I'm not finding any on ebay, so if anybody has one to sell, post me a note here please.",278,,,

chiffonade,0,"When my mom went out with her friends, my brother and I would buy a box of these and kill it in one sitting because she wouldn't buy it for us if we asked for it. It wasn't out for very long - and probably had a jillion grams of sugar. My rating? Healthwise, Rotten. Fun-wise, Awesome.",278,,,
Toy Surprize,5,Probably I only ever ate this just once... just to get the Spy Scope!,278,,,

Quispy,5,Great cereal!,278,,,
CreepysFan,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Loved Pink Panther Flakes as a kid, used to eat them as I watched the Pink Panther cartoons. Bought an original box on ebay a couple of years ago. Probably my second favorite cereal after Freakies.",278,,,
coachbrj,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  My favorite all-time cereal. I loved drinking the pink milk afterwards. BRING IT BACK!!,278,,,
Goody,5,I also loved it. Too bad they don't bring it back.,278,,,
yankee,5,I wish I could have some cereal with frosted pink flakes. I never had it before. sob.,278,,,
CerealKiller,5,Very tasty when it was on the market. It was basically frosted corn flakes with red dye. Too bad the dye cuased cancer and the cereal was discontinued.,278,,,
BiGolly,0,I remember eating this while watching Speed Buggy and The Super Friends on Saturday morning when I was 10 years old. I only remember that it was pink.,278,,,
pink,5,"It did have a strawberry flavor - it was better than plain old Frosted Flakes. Best cereal ever. Of course, everything I like gets discontinued. Cute toys inside too!",278,,,
slade1955,0,(Team Breakfast Member) Never tried it. Pink milk huh?,278,,,
BadWX,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved this stuff more than life itself. Hey, when you're 7 years old... cereal can mean that much. Now, granted my memories are some 35 years old... but I seem to remember a distinct strawberry taste. I ate these every day for months on end, so I have a strong memory... but it's an old one. I could be wrong. But, this was one of my absolute all time favorites. I don't buy much cereal now, but I would clean the store shelves of this stuff it was ever made again.",278,,,

Anna,5,"It was so delicious. We would even snack on this cereal without milk, especially the strawberry one. I don't think any berry flavored cereal has matched that yummy taste. One of the best snacks I remember from my childhood.",281,,,
Firebugmichelle,5,My favorite cereal ever! I would love to see it back on shelves. Same recipe please. No need to tamper with perfection.,281,,,
Orgazoid,5,"I would eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and then again as a midnight snack. Simply orgasmic.",281,,,
Steve-Os,5,"Wow, I can't believe I forgot about this cereal. This had to be possibly my favorite cereal too now that I think about it. I remember buying a few boxes of the Strawberry Pop Tart version and they were so good. It's probably a good thing they don't bring these back. I'd probably become unhealthy in no time eating them box by box. Great cereal though. Probably one of the best of discontinued cereals.",281,,,
Hurst,5,They NEED to bring this cereal back like yesterday.,281,,,
Monica,5,I loved this cereal and I was so disappointed when it was no longer on the shelves! BRING IT BACK PLEASE! It was so delicious.,281,,,
bethywethy17,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I vaguely remember this cereal but I never had it.,281,,,
P.M.,5,"If you guys really want to bring this back, go to the Kellogg's website and request it.",281,,,
PanteraJohnson,5,"The strawberry was the best! Unfortunately, I hardly remember what it tasted like, but I know it was my favorite cereal for years. Please bring it back! Everyone loved it, so it would make a lot of people very happy... Imagine the Wild! Berry flavor as a cereal. I would eat that until I explode.",281,,,
HardcoreNicky,5,"I have tried remembering what this cereal was called for so long. I could even remember how it tasted but couldn't remember the name and I just googled cereal of the 90s and as soon as I saw the box, I was like THAT'S IT! I was born in 1991 and ate this when I was little and still remember loving it. Bring it back!",281,,,
Doolanger,5,I'm anxiously awaiting the return of this cereal. I keep waiting and waiting. It was the best. Will my dream of eating it again ever come true?,281,,,
cherylmars84,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Please bring it back! I grew up eating that cereal. I am 30 years old and you know how long that cereal has been off the shelves? Yeah, well I still crave that good ol' Strawberry Pop Tart cereal. I have tried many, many, many Kellogg's cereals and products and anything else ever made by or ever will be made by Kellogg's will or have ever compared. Dipping Pop Tarts in milk doesn't come close - not even the snack size ones which are a bit to crunchy and hard - but that's my opinion. - Cheryl",281,,,
Moonxtal,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Oh God... this cereal! I was SO IN LOVE with the strawberry! I'd get it every time we went to the supermarket. I tried the cinnamon but I didn't like it very much. I swear the strawberry was filled with crack... and I was addicted hard core! Krave cereal is sort of like it... only in the way it looks (little rectangles with something on the inside) but that's where the similarities end. I do like Krave too tho... :3,281,,,
Flashman2,5,I loved it so much! I hate that now I have to make my own version by toasting Pop Tarts and crumbling them into a bowl. Please bring this cereal back... also in a blueberry flavor please.,281,,,

leann,5,"Strawberry Pop-Tart cereal was the best! Good for you and got kids to actually drink milk which is also good for you. Bring this cereal back please! Oh, this and Coconut Yoohoo!",281,,,

Pop-Tart Guy,0,"It's easy to make this, minus the crunch. All this time, I thought that Kellogg's never had any sort of Pop-Tart cereal, and I've been 'making' my own. It would be neat to see this in stores; I think this way it would be much more authentic.",281,,,
Pitterz,5,I loved Pop-Tarts Crunch. It should have lasted a lot longer. Please bring it back.,281,,,

dnew98,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I also wish they would bring back Strawberry Pop-Tarts Cereal... loved eating it when I was growing up... then after finishing my last box of it, I went to the store to get an other box and I was told they quit making it... that just bummed me out and kept me wanting more.",281,,,
Twist112,5,Please bring the strawberry Pop Tarts Crunch back. I'm pregnant and really want it right now!,281,,,

YumNTum,5,PLEASE bring the Strawberry Pop Tart Crunch Cereal back! I hate when companies hook you on something and then take it away. Same goes for you Don Miguel!,281,,,
ewhak,5,"Now that Kellogg's is filling cereal pieces with stuff again ala their Krave cereals (which are just okay), I wish they would consider bringing this cereal back. They can just use the same equipment, right? Bring it back!",281,,,
T. Tuxedo,5,I'm with everybody here... bring Pop-Tarts Crunch back! It was the best. These new Kellogg's cereals with fillings don't compare at all.,281,,,

baby88915,5,I have to take real pop-tarts heat them then cut them up to even get close to this cereal. Come on already that's too messy! I think they should release it again and I would buy at least 2 boxes a week.,281,,,

berv,5,This was my favorite cereal ever! It was like eating a bowl full of magic! I would do anything to just have 1 bowl of Powdered Donutz Cereal! Please come back! Pretty please!,282,,,
Warlocke,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  There are a lot of cereals out there that taste like each other, either because they're made with similar ingredients or one is a deliberate knock-off, but nothing else tasted like Powdered Donutz cereal: Not before it came out, and not since it was discontinued. It was simple and not overly sweet, but tasted amazing. Definitely on my list of things I wish would make a reappearance.",282,,,
Older Elton,5,I still vividly remember the taste and texture of this cereal. I can't forget it. This is why I want a time machine.,282,,,

James Chicago,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This cereal really did taste like donuts.

Cereal K2,5,"This was the best cereal in the whole world. I drive my wife nuts talking about it, and every time I go to a new grocery store I look for it, even though I know they don't make it anymore.. GM wouldn't know a good thing if it smacked them upside the head.",282,,,

Please, for the love of cereal, I beg you, please bring back our Donutz!!",282,,,
meme,5,"I googled donut flavored cereal because eating Cheerio's strawberry yogurt reminded me of this long forgotten treat. Seriously, try the strawberry yogurt cheerioos for yourself, and see if the especially clumpy with flavoring bits don't remind you of donutz.",282,,,
weenie,5,*sniff* I miss this cereal. I can almost taste the powdered goodness as I watch the old commercials.,282,,,

carolina36,5,Great cereal - I can still hear the tune from the commercial in my head.,282,,,
JB,5,This cereal was excellent! This is what cereal is suppose to taste like. Not the whole grain rip-offs they pass as cereal these days. Bring back this cereal and the genius that created it!,282,,,
bigdonutzfan,5,"I have thought about this cereal for almost 30 years. I never knew what it was called since when I was eating it I was only 4 or 5 so I got online and googled powdered sugar donut cereal and up popped the box of powdered donutz cereal and I knew right away! I can still taste them, they were amazing and seriously just like a powdered donut. I don't remember them being crispy but maybe that's just because they softened up in the milk? They were the best cereal I ever had and If I had a chance I would order as many boxes as I could... please bring these back!!",282,,,
C.S.H.,5,Please please bring these back... this was my favorite cereal... I'm dying for a bowl!,282,,,
Julie in NE,5,I also miss Donutz... it was my favorite... I can't believe they kept some others and got rid of this one :-(,282,,,
Annettej,5,Please bring it back!,282,,,
Mr. Donutz,5,"This was my favorite cereal growing up. It had the perfect mix of sweetness and the texture of the actual cereal was indescribable. I miss this cereal soooo much. I look at every new grocery store I go to, to see if they may have reproduced it. I have been disappointed in my search for nearly 20 years now. Last box I got was when my dad brought one back from Germany about 2 years after they weren't in our local grocery stores. Cereal companies should have 1 month out of the year where they resell some of their old disconnected cereals. What a marketing campaign that would be. I'd by 100 boxes.",282,,,
ImissDonutz,5,I want some Donutz Cereal soooo bad. :(,282,,,
gogo,5,This was the Very Best cereal ever!,282,,,
Lonnie S.,5,I loved this cereal. It was awesome. Powdered sugar tasted like the same sugar of actual donuts.,282,,,
donutzfan,5,This was the best cereal ever. I wish I could order it now!!!!,282,,,

Kelly J.,5,"This is hands down the best sugar cereal ever! It was basically fruity Rice Krispies with pop rocks in it! It sounded weird, but tasted amazing and was fun to eat. Maybe I should just try adding Pop Rocks to some Fruity Pebbles and see if that works :) Yum!",551,,,

Anj,0,"Don't remember the taste, but the best commercials.",286,,,
Pete,5,"I remember in the mid 70s in Scotland when I was about 7 or 8 loving this stuff. I loved Sooty on the box too, so it was a double smash. I think my mum thought it was too sugary or something. Used to look for it when older and never saw it. Bring it back!",286,,,
Aron,5,"It didn't disappear around 1975 because I was born in 1970 and I was still eating this well past the age of 5, until my teens I think. I don't recognize any of the box fronts here... it always used to have a blue hippo on the box, in the UK anyway.",286,,,
Southern Soul,0,"To northern soul: This was my all time favorite cereal. Re: your reference to top of the milk... I always made sure that I got up before my brothers, so that I could pour the top of the gold top, milk on it.",286,,,
Stevo,5,I stopped having breakfast when this was discontinued. My mum could never find a replacement so I never ate cereal for breakfast again.,286,,,
-matthew-,5,"I was born in 1976 in the UK and I was eating this in the mid 80's so the wikipedia entry saying it was discontinued in 1975 is incorrect. In response to an earlier post... it's true that there was a blue hippo on the packet at the time, I'm just surprised that I can't find any evidence backing this up on line.",286,,,
Postman,5,Puffa Puffa Rice has not been available (manufactured) in over thirty years maybe closer to 40. That response was ridiculous.,286,,,
Doglover3033,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I recently wrote to Kellogg's asking if they would ever bring it back as I loved it as a child and this is what they said: ""Thank you for your inquiry about where to buy Kellogg's Puffa Puffa Rice. We're sorry to disappoint you but it looks like that this product is no longer stocked in the major supermarkets and is more than likely set to be discontinued. Further supplies may become available for a limited time in independent shops or discounter stores but at present we don’t have any further information as to where it might be available to buy. Thanks again for contacting Kellogg's."" I'm Gutted! :(",286,,,
Dave-9,5,The best cereal of all time. Didn't it feature a blue hippo character on a green box at some point?,286,,,

lynea1943,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  'Ono' cereal! Hawaiian for good! Wonderful, light taste of 'caramel' from the cane brown sugar. Not too sweet, just right. I'm a Senior Citizen and still remember this cereal! Heck, I remember commercials for 'Sugar Jets' more than 60 years ago! Sad so many awful cereal out there. Ned to bring back some of the 'golden goodies'! - Lynea, West Linn, Oregon",286,,,
Harper-2,5,"I love, love, loved this! Multigrain Cheerios remind me a little bit of them - but nothing matches!",286,,,
Arnie,5,"Kellogg's should bring this back. After all, they must still have the recipe in a vault somewhere. By Arnold.",286,,,
Chrislef,5,This was the best cereal. I was devastated when they stopped making it. Kellogg's should (and MUST) bring it back!,286,,,
Harrison,5,"This was my all-time absolute favorite cereal. I know it's not likely to ever come back, but a guy can wish.",286,,,
Ben,5,Can still taste them in my mind. Seems like only yesterday!,286,,,

C.J.,5,I loved this cereal as child. I also loved the commercial with the Hawaiian theme.,286,,,
A. Fanboy,5,"I think they'd be smart to bring this one back. Since it is a rice cereal, that means gluten free, right? There could definitely be a market!",286,,,
sis,5,I think about this cereal all the time. I remember the commercial with the volcano. I loved this cereal so much. Please make it again.,286,,,
JayHawke,3,"Face it folks, Kellogg's is not bringing back this cereal. It's nice that it brings back happy memories for many all those years ago. In a bowl - put half plain puffed rice and half Kellogg's smacks or Post Golden Crisp, pour milk and enjoy. That's the closest you'll get to the flavor of this nowadays.",286,,,
Memaw,5,"This was my favorite cereal. Kellogg's, please bring this back. You will make a lot of people very happy!",286,,,
mord,5,"I loved this is a youngster. I just thought about it, and here I am on this site, seeing lots of other people who also loved it. It was the only cereal I would eat with cold AND warm milk. I wish it was available. Does Kellogg's even know about the people here?",286,,,
I.M.A.M.,0,What a nice forum here... Puffa Puffa Rice was ambrosia. I had contacted Kellogg's with a suggestion/request... very polite about it and I got a mumbled answer from whoever about marketing surveys and declined re-release requests.,286,,,
ToolShedd,4,One of my favorites as a child. Really wish these would get re-released. Still have some nice toy dinosaurs that came as a prize with this.,286,,,
Lin90blue,5,"Please, Please Kellogg's bring this delicious cereal back. I loved it as a kid and have been raving to my kids about it. I would so much love for them to try it. Please!",286,,,
Pam T.,5,My fingers are crossed that Puffa Puffa Rice returns. Happy to see so many other fans.,286,,,
Northern Soul,5,"A blast from the past! I just loved Puffa Puffa Rice as a child. My brothers were NOT allowed any. Mum didn't buy it often, but when she did it was all mine. I loved it best with the top (cream) of the milk - you don't get that any more either!",286,,,

Firequeen,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved this cereal. The best ever. Wish they would bring it back.,286,,,
Surfer,5,"In the UK, I think that they were finally discontinued in about 1985. I know I ate them in the early 1980s although by then they were a rare find in a supermarket. Such is my nostalgia that I have almost perfected a method of making them since Kellogg's refuses to. As you might suspect, they do indeed have an enormous sugar content. The ingredients in order of weight are: rice, granulated sugar, vegetable oil, demerara sugar, salt. In today's health conscious world, I doubt they will make a commercial comeback, so I'll make do with mine homemade ones once a month!",286,,,
Puffa D.,5,Amazing cereal. I loved it. I'm sure I was older than 6 when this was discontinued.,286,,,

Chucky Larms,3,"According to the history, I was only 2 years old when this disappeared. Yet I have a very vivid memory of it, even the weird hamster food smell of it.",286,,,
Dr. Detroit,5,I love me some Puffa Puffa Rice. I wish they'd bring it back.,286,,,

MoeVin,5,I loved this cereal as a child and would definitely buy it now if Kellogg's brought it back!,286,,,
Phoenix117,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Puffs Puffa Rice was the best and most tasty cereal. I do not know why it was taken off the market. It would be great to see it back in the shops again. I would certainly buy it.,286,,,
DaveD,5,This was my favorite ever cereal and I would love to buy this again!,286,,,
jennied,5,I loved this cereal! I'm on board with everybody else... bring it back!,286,,,

reverend dismas,5,My childhood was full of excellent sugary cereal like Puffa Puff and All-Stars.,286,,,
Mrs Rice,5,Best breakfast ever!!,286,,,
taylor,5,The best! I so miss this cereal and would love to eat it again.,286,,,

Ty100,0,Is there any way of bringing this cereal back? I loved it growing up.,286,,,
Jett,5,Is there any way of bringing this cereal back? Loved this cereal growing up.,286,,,
S. Beaddy,5,"A cornerstone of my childhood menu! In 1982, I found a small box of it in one of those multi-packs as I was passing through London on a trip. It was as delicious as I remembered, and I vowed to buy out all the grocery stores I could find in London on my way back through a week later. However, when I returned there was not a single box to be found. I still think that whatever forces out there that are determined to take away foods that I love spent the 7 days between my two visits clearing all the stores of this cereal, just to spite me. :-)",286,,,
PPR Super Fan,5,"Puffa Puffa Rice was my breakfast staple for as long as I can remember. I tried to revive it by having Sugar Puffs, but they just don't match up :(",286,,,
Postman,5,I loved this cereal also. Please bring it back.,286,,,
Goober,5,Can we write to Kellogg's? I don't think they realize this was the best cereal ever made. I could eat three bowls right now with freezing cold milk.,286,,,
norman,5,Best cereal in the best of times. Come on... bring it back!,286,,,
J.T.,5,"I think you can still get this in Germany. However, it is called Smacks.I tastes like I remember back in the day. I assume the name is problematic in the UK though.",286,,,
Mouse,5,This cereal was the best part of my childhood! I miss it. Bring it back please!,286,,,
mambo,5,I agree it was the greatest of them all. 38 years have passed since it disappeared from my local supermarket and I can still taste it!,286,,,
Nancy,5,"Isn't the internet wonderful? I've mourned the passing of Puffa Puffa Rice for most of my life and thought I was the only one who felt betrayed by Kellogg's when they discontinued it. Nice to know I'm not the only one. Here's the good news - I also mourned the discontinuance of McCormick's mayonnaise, and now it's BACK. My family can't get enough. Maybe there's hope for Puffa Puffa Rice. Of course, it's been so elevated in my mind over the years that it may not live up to my memory of it. And there's probably all sorts of terrible ingredients in it that my 50-year-old self would never want to eat.",286,,,
Manowar-ss,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My favorite as a little boy. If it didn't sell well, I would be surprised because it was sublime. I swear there was an animated commercial with the two kids in the Hawaiian canoe but alas, like everything about Puffa Puffa Rice, it seems to have disappeared. Or maybe I just imagined it.",286,,,
ppr boy,5,I loved PPR! My favorite! I will never forgive them for discontinuing PPR!,286,,,
Miss Puffa,5,Best of all time. Bring it back. I loved it.,286,,,
gary63,5,I lost my first tooth while eating this cereal. No I didn't swallow the tooth. :-),286,,,
Clark,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  The real taste of early 1970's breakfast! I loved it. Wish they would bring it back. It can't have been any worse than many of today's cereals! The reason there are no E-numbers on today's cereals is that the 'ingredient' is spelt out in full... still the same but just not labeled with an 'E'. Come on Kellogg's! Bring it back!,286,,,
Pamela,5,It was the best brekkie ever! Would buy it again in a heartbeat.,286,,,
skiddie95,0,Is there anything similar on the market today? Or can we figure out a recipe that comes close?,286,,,
traceycat,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  PLEASE put it back on the shelves. I still crave for a bowl of the best cereal ever made.,286,,,
Fink,5,"Whom do we call to get this cereal back on the shelves. If they can bring back Quisp, they can certainly bring back PPR. It was the best cereal... EVER!",286,,,
mariestempert,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My favorite, too! I find it hard to believe that Kellogg's can't make a healthier version of Puffa Puffa Rice and bring it back. Both kids and adults would love it.",286,,,
Puffa Kim,0,It was the best cereal ever. I can still taste it and smell it... and I long to eat it again!,286,,,
L.J.M.,0,"I think they stopped it in the UK for 2 reasons. 1) It was expensive for a small box back then, so it didn't sell very well; and 2) I think it contained lots of E-numbers so they wouldn't bring it back now anyway. All this healthy eating has killed it and if they did bring it back... I don't think it would actually taste anything like the original. Shame... I loved it.",286,,,
rommy,5,Loved this. Have thought about it on many occasions. I thought I would never ever find anyone who remembered it!,286,,,
hair1066,5,My favorite ever cereal.,286,,,
timmer,5,"Fun and great-tasting cereal from my youth. Surely Kellogg's could spruce it up, reduce the sugar a bit, and re-market it today. C'Mon, Kellogg's! Give the people what they want, Puffa-Puffa Rice! (oh, and keep that awesome song - ""...a digga-digga bowlful, Oceans of Energy! A-ya, A-ya!""",286,,,
Ponana,5,Best cereal every created - why oh why can't they bring it back!,286,,,
digger44,5,I wish Kellogg's would reintroduce Puffa Puffa Rice cereal. It was my all-time favorite as a child.,286,,,
codswhollop,5,"I have written to Kellogg's pleading that they bring it back, but no luck. In this day and age, it's far too unhealthy they said.",286,,,
Purple Biddy,5,I wish Puffa Puffa Rice would come back. It was the most gorgeous tasting cereal ever made. Please come back.,286,,,
Barbara,5,This was my favorite cereal as a child. I tried to explain the taste to my children but... all I can say is DELICIOUS. Please bring it back!!,286,,,
aylessa,5,Loved this cereal as a child. This and Golden Nuggets!,286,,,
Helzz,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Finally, I have found a site that mentions the fabulous Puffa Puffa Rice. My husband thought it was in my head... I can still remember the taste with freezing cold milk before school! Bring it back, I'd definitely buy it again!",286,,,

Lambtons,5,Please bring Puffa Puffa Rice cereal back. My family misses the awesome good cereal.,286,,,

B.A.S.,5,I loved this cereal and would love it if it came back. Bring back Puffa Puffa Rice!,286,,,
Jim44,5,People thought I was making this cereal up - so glad to find proof. Nothing compared to this morning kick start. Bring it back for old times sake!,286,,,
Agent Puffy,5,"This cereal was the best ever! Hot diggity, dog diggity. I want my children to try it. Bring it back, PLEASE!",286,,,
Misty,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This was my favorite cereal of all time. I wish Kellogg's would bring it back with some of the other vintage cereals as a tribute to the baby boomers who grew up with them. I would share them with my grandchildren as I am sure many others would. You might be surprised at the revenue it would generate for Kellogg's. Please bring back Puffa Puffa Rice.,286,,,
Nozbob,5,Puffa Puffa Rice was my favorite cereal and I have tried to buy it over the years after it was discontinued. Why was it discontinued anyway? Bring it back please.,286,,,
decatur pat,5,Please bring this cereal back. I'm a 67 year old female whose daughter continually brings up how I refused to share my Puffa Rice back in the day. I'd treat her to 100 boxes if they would make them again.,286,,,
DougChandler,5,"I used to eat Puffa Puffa Rice and Butter Ready Brek as a child. The nearest thing I have had to Puffa Puffa Rice is Cherios because one of the 4 grains is rice and it is similar, but not as good.",286,,,
gentle giant,5,"Ahhhhh - I loved this cereal so much my mum always had a rolling stock of 5 packets because I used to eat it morning, noon and night. Please Kellogg's bring it back, if I was a multimillionaire, I'd buy a factory to try to replicate it. It's in my top 5 of all time things.",286,,,
Postman,5,I really enjoyed this cereal.,286,,,
tracylou,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This was my favorite cereal when I was a kid and I haven't eaten breakfast since they stopped making it because nothing tasted like it... come on Kellogg's... get the world's greatest cereal back on the shelf pretty please!,286,,,
Mr. V.,5,"Why, oh why, did they kill off the king of cereals? Come on Kellogg's - extract thy finger and get it back on the shelves.",286,,,

Stevros,5,The greatest cereal. Can't believe it's 37 years since I've had it! Just mailed Kellogg's to get it back on the shelves.,286,,,
SGreen,5,I would love to try this again. It was my favorite childhood cereal! Loved it and often dream of having a bowl. I remember the boxes being too small :),286,,,
B.J.,5,The best cereal ever. My brother and I had to have a packet each with our names on so that one couldn't eat more than the other!,286,,,
Sad Panda,5,I miss-a miss-a my Puffa Puffa so much.,286,,,
tripper,5,"I so want these brought back, we need a campaign to rally Kellogg's... we want PPR back NOW.",286,,,
siamese b.,5,"I am on a mission to Kellogg's every day I email them, so should everyone else for the bring-back of PPR. If enough of us do it, I bet they will too. It won't be quick but sooner or later I believe they will, so come on everyone lets all play a huge part in bringing it back!",286,,,
jamalata,0,(Team Breakfast Member) I loved this cereal. Where can I buy it in the UK? Is it still being made?,286,,,
Puffa Junky,5,"This was my favorite breakfast cereal for both my brother and I. I was brought up in Arizona in the very early 70's, My paternal grandmother bought this cereal for the two of us and we loved it! When it was no longer available, we felt like a part of our childhood had gone away. I would pay any price to have a bowl or two... have searched countless stores in search for this over the years but then the internet gave me the answers I just didn't want to hear. I'd have recommended this to everyone and anyone. It was THAT GOOD! It is very unusual for a product so good to be discontinued... obviously the Kellogg's folks don't try their own products or they would still be selling it!",286,,,
Ravi,5,"Still remember it, surprised when I couldn't buy it. Glad to see there's demand for it. Rice Krispies is definitely not the same and can never make up for its loss!",286,,,
gaya,0,Please bring this cereal back along with Sugar Stars. Our kids are missing so much.,286,,,
Mercy,5,Bring it back. I can still taste it when I think about it. I'm glad to see other people liked it as much as I did. Puffa Puffa Rice rocks!,286,,,

wayne,5,I remember loving this cereal. I wonder why it didn't last.,286,,,

Team Taylor,5,I've never stopped thinking about Puffa Puffa Rice. Just loved it and used to eat it at any time of the day. I've even told my kids about it and can't imagine why they don't make it anymore. Bring it back!,286,,,
P.A.E.,0,"A newa, a nowa, Kellogg's a bring you, new kinda break-a-fast cereal, him puff and toast 'em nice, him call Kellogg's a puffa puffa rice, wa-ooo, newee newee, a nickee nickee po po, you catch 'em a heep big flavor, oceans of energy-call Kellogg's a puffa puffa rice, a-yeh a-yeh...

TurkTownBlue,4,"This was one I tried to remember for years. As a kid we rarely got the ""fancy"" cereals - Rice Krispies and Shreddies were the staples as I recall - but every now and then I would taste something (like the Rice Cheerios) and the memory came flooding back. I could picture the cereal but not the name. Colleagues hadn't a clue what I was on about: ""Like sugar puffs but made from rice!"" They all thought I meant Rice Krispies but they are all TOO YOUNG to remember the true joy that was PPR!",286,,,
candygirl,5,"I miss this cereal. Now days, I get some puffed rice - just whatever the store brand is - and sprinkle some brown sugar on top. It's not the same to be sure, but it brings back memories of Puffa Puffa Rice for me.",286,,,
Titey,5,I had my last box in the 80's. They still sold it in Malta. I would love it if they would bring it back. Please...,286,,,
Duffy,5,"Yes! I totally remember this one. I think it's funny how they advertised this as like being Hawaiian. I mean... wasn't it just puffed rice. How hard would it have been to add coconut and pineapple flavor and really make it taste Hawaiian? If I had a time machine and knew people from Kellogg's, I'd make it right.",286,,,
freetoyinside,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I only remember my last box of PUFFA PUFFA RICE in of all places Hawaii. I was in the Air Force and from there shipped all over the world. When I arrived back home to the mid-west, late '70, Puffa Puffa was gone! Bummer. Told my kids like everyone else. Even tried to make it myself once as a culinary chemistry project but no luck, mine tasted ok but it wasn't PPR.",286,,,
Lindaloo,5,I remember this cereal as my favorite as a child in the late 60's early 70's. Tried to describe it to my kids and the only thing I can loosely compare it with is 'Swizzel Matlows Rainbow Drops' without the colours and bumps! Really wish Kellogg's would bring back Puffa Puffa Rice just as it was then. PLEASE!,286,,,

PublicEnemy009,5,"I have 2 boxes in my cupboard, one is almost gone. It is only for a limited time in Canada. So good, reminds me of the Reese's cereal that's readily available here, but more of a subtle peanut flavor accompanying the Cap'n Crunch flavor.",273,,,
A. R.,3,"Peanut Butter Crunch Fun Globes Box - Never got the glowing moon of course. During its run, I managed to get 5 earth globes. And of course the dopey kid in the neighborhood managed to get 3. To this day, I'm angry about not getting the Moon.",273,,,
Postman,5,Peanut Butter Crunch is back in the stores.,273,,,

jaydkids@yahoo.,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My family loves Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch cereal. However, I can no longer find it on the grocer shelves. What has happened?",273,,,
markx1000,1,(Team Breakfast Member)  Bought a box of the Peanut Butter Crunch and was sad. Didn't taste anything like peanut butter.,273,,,
former fan,2,Just bought my last box... the peanut butter flavor has gone away?!,273,,,
CerealCrusher,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  One of my absolute favorites... ever. Still a great taste, just a pain to crush those roundels. (Same issue with any puff or extruded Os, GF or not.)",273,,,
James Chicago,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  This was my favorite cereal for years until Reese's Puffs hit the market. Now they are both tied for first place with me.,273,,,
StickUp4Breakfa,5,Spectacular cereal! The most enduring of the Cap'n spinoffs - deservedly so!,273,,,
NostalgiaL,4,"It doesn't taste as good as it used to, but it's still far better than most of the boring cereals on the market.",273,,,
d.o.n.,3,They don't even taste like peanut butter anymore. What happened?,273,,,
bethywethy17,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  One of my favorite cereals ever! I can just snack on a box of these. This is my hubby's all-time favorite cereal.,273,,,
Robnoxious,1,"Worst ever! I wanted the premium - talked my Aunt into buying a box. Her rule: finish the cereal first. I choked down a bowl or two, then snuck the toy out when she wasn't looking.",273,,,
FETT1,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  HI from WESTERN CANADA... one of my all time favorites. It's really a shame that CANADA ONLY has REGULAR Cap'n these days... we did have a test product 2 years ago with CHOCOLATE Cap'n... but NO PEANUT BUTTER! ne other note... I remember when the cereal was packed in a foil type bag... have had a sample from a US contact and was amazed how the bag was unlike any other bag! The flavor back in the day was so PEANUT BUTTER tasting. Oh miss it and ALL THE COOL PREMIUMS... I'm looking for VINTAGE PREMIUMS from any cereal... GREAT SITE! THANK YOU! -Jason,273,,,
cerealfiend,5,"This stuff is dangerously delicious. I didn't discover this wonderfulness until college (grew up in a plain-cheerios-and-bran-flakes household), and it has quickly become one of my favorite light night study snacks. Perfect blend of salty and sweet and great just out of the box. I have a fondness for the Kix-like shape, too, which doesn't make the roof of my mouth bleed like with the regular Cap'n.",273,,,
rkade111,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Long live Smedley! If you love peanut butter, this is the stuff. I love this cereal as a midnight snack with milk of course. It has true peanut butter flavor and stays fairly crunchy in milk. Also, love the color orange, so the packaging grabs me.",273,,,
The Pet,5,Simply the best! I've been eating the Cap'n for forty years and this is my favorite flavor.,273,,,
Ernie,5,"My favorite flavor of the current Crunch family. Sweet peanut butter taste, and not as hard on your mouth as the regular Cap'n.",273,,,
MyEmptyCanvas,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I have a big box of these in front of me right now (the ""20% more"" box)!! :D I LOVE this cereal... it has the right amount of crunch and absorbs a good amount of milk for a bit of softness. (myemptycanvasreviews.blogspot.com)",273,,,
Drury,4,I really miss this cereal here in Canada. Is it still available in the US?,273,,,
Mmm-Hmm!,5,"Not very healthy, but dang, this stuff is good!",273,,,
Tony,5,Deeelicious peanut butter flavor. A classic.,273,,,
Waxy_Ulcer_Mouf,2,"As far as taste goes I'd give it a 5, but because of its consistency I cannot even eat it! I still have ulcers in my mouth from eating a bowl 2 days ago. Also, as for the ""stays crunchy, even in milk"" promise on the box-this is obviously because the cereal is coated with wax! YUK!!! It was like eating ""sandpaper-peanut-butter-candle""",273,,,
Derekdespie,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Cap'n Crunch, everyone's favorite breakfast pirate, will be returning to television in commercials around the next year, because orange-flavoured crunch berries will be added to the existing four colorful fruity flavors of crunch berries. The following three most-popular varieties of the Cap'n Crunch breakfast cereal line are: ""Original Crunch"" (which consists of nothing but the sweetened corn squares), ""Crunch Berries"" (which consists of sweetened corn squares combined with five colorful fruity flavors of crunch berries), and ""Peanut Butter Crunch"" (which consists of nothing but the peanut butter-flavoured corn cereal puffs), and will unveil their 2011 artwork with an image of Cap'n Crunch himself holding up to about five pieces of each of his cereals instead of just four.",273,,,
blueconversechucks,5,Much gentler on my mouth lining than regular Cap'n Crunch. I used to think this must be what scooby snacks taste like.,273,,,
ficwriterpaul,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  It is worth the mouth wounds. The best peanut butter flavor of any cereal made.,273,,,
Captain Tasty,5,Great cereal although it leaves your mouth raw after eating 3 bowls.,273,,,

Looking4OldFavs,5,"I used to buy this cereal all the time. It was awesome. At the same time they sold it, I used to buy bags of only dried cereal marshmallows like the ones in Lucky Charms. The store I shopped at stopped carrying them and I never saw them again. Any clue where I can buy them? They only cost about $1.50 or so. Now people sell them $5.00 for 3 oz. That is ridiculous. Any ideas where one might find them today?",1453,,,
The Truth,5,"This cereal was not an imitation of Quisp. It is the same cereal rebranded. In the mid 90s, Quaker who produced this Popeye cereal, dropped Popeye and just called it Sweet Crunch, then it faded away by the 2000s, only to briefly reappear as Quisp again sold online. Now it's all gone. But quite frankly having tried all varied names of this cereal. I know why Quaker wont' bring this cereal back. It's already there. It's Captain Crunch! Quaker wised up and stopped selling reshaped cereal as they had done over the past 50 years.",1453,,,
Love It,5,If they bring back Popeye cereal... I will finally eat breakfast again!,1453,,,
ilovepopeye,5,I loved this cereal as a little kid. I also searched for it as an adult and found the Quaker Oat Crisp cereal. It's not the same. I agree this cereal should be brought back and the recipe used to make it should not be changed. I hate how they have changed the taste of some of our cereals today. I still buy cereal today and lots of it. I have to have at least 5 boxes at all times. Lol! I live in Milwaukee and I go to Illinois just to buy the crisp cereal. Please bring this one back.,1453,,,
Lionhearted,0,This cereal was the same as Quisp. I say that because it was made by the same company.,1453,,,

kika,0,I use to always get this cereal as a little girl. PLEASE BRING IT BACK! Even if it's temporary! It's a classic!,1453,,,
B. Jerry,5,They need to bring it back! Also bring back the Popeye regular puffed rice. I loved them both.,1453,,,
Kristygp,5,Does anyone know where this cereal can be purchased? I have been searching and searching for a long time trying to find it to expose my kids to this amazing cereal. I don't even care if I have to order off the internet.,1453,,,
jswag,5,I grew up eating the bagged Popeye cereals. I liked them all but this cereal was the best. Please bring it back.,1453,,,
john,0,Where can I find Popeye Sweet Crunch? I haven't had it since I was a kid and I really want to have it again. I live in Oklahoma and I can't find it anywhere. Please help. I'm having Popeye withdrawals.,1453,,,
MzKenyada,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved this cereal so much. I wish they could bring it back.,1453,,,
Strutz,4,Yes.. I also grew up eating this cereal. It had its own taste that no other cereal had. Why do you think a lot of people are commenting on this? It does remind you of those good childhood memories - like waking up on the weekend and racing your brothers and sisters to the cereal bowls.,1453,,,
amazing,5,Omg. This was one of the best cereal that they could have put on the market. I can taste it right now. Where can I find this cereal? I miss the taste. If I can find this cereal I wouldn't buy any other cereal but this one...,1453,,,
Chicago G.,5,I found some cereal just like this in Chicago and there is only one store that has it. I would love to tell you but they may start to run out when I get there.,1453,,,
prettygirl79,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I am 33 years old and I grew up on this cereal. One of the many good things of my childhood. What happened? Is Popeye coming back? I sure hope so.,1453,,,
motown2,5,Where is this cereal? It's like it's been wiped off the planet. It'll be a real shame if it was discontinued. I love it.,1453,,,
808kid,5,I have yet to find a cereal that could compare to it. I'm missing the great taste this provided when I was a kid. Where can it be ordered since I know Hawaii will never have it?,1453,,,
Mary Jo,5,"Yes, I love Sweet Crunch and I can't find it in Maryland either. They used to sell it in Mars but now they don't carry it anymore. I would like for them to bring it back too.",1453,,,
Gigi,5,Best cereal EVER!!!,1453,,,
Scion,5,This was the best cereal ever. Hard to find now.,1453,,,
theresa,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved Popeye Sweet Crunch cereal when I was a child and I wish Quaker would consider bringing this cereal back so my kids could know what this Popeye Sweet Crunch meant to their mom because I tell them about it all the time but they will never know what I'm talking about. This cereal is not in the stores. I have look for this all over Chicago. So please tell Quaker to bring this one back.,1453,,,
Rock,5,Popeye cereal is so under rated. I think because of the cheap promotion of not introducing the cereal in a box is why people didn't give it a chance. Bagged cereal equals generic in a lot of consumers eyes. I will stack my house top to bottom with this cereal in a heart beat. Where can I purchase this cereal?,1453,,,
freshbrew,5,I loved this cereal since high school!,1453,,,

Stargazer83,3,"(Team Breakfast Member)  With all do respect, I have to disagree with the others. I was born in 65 and ate my share of Post Toasties and found that Kellogg's Corn Flakes had a much better corn taste. Another long running cereal has just ended production... Alpha Bits is no longer around.",740,,,
kard,0,Why did Post discontinue Post Toasties?,740,,,
Postman,5,What a cool story @JohnKP.,740,,,
JohnKP,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) I am now 97. In my youth, I was a follower of Inspector Post and applied for all of the official badges. I was still with him when he was reported to have gone to South America on a case. I miss him.",740,,,
suzannee,5,"LOVE Post Toasties, and have since a kid. I used to bake with them until they disappeared... now I'm disappointed. Would be ELATED if they were brought back on the shelves! So much better for you than those 'sugar-coated' cereals! And TASTE better too!",740,,,
MHJ,5,"I, too, miss this cereal. The current corn cereals just do not have that great taste! - MHJ",740,,,
CJ,5,I agree with some of the other reviews. Post Toasties corn flakes were much better than some of the other brands of corn flakes. By CJ,740,,,
L.O.V.E. Toasties,0,I loved Post Toasties. Why is it when they have a great product they quit making it and go with the yucky stuff ugh. I know they won't bring them back. That's the way life is with the people in power that run the show. Marjorie Merriweather Post is dead by now. I guess so goes Post Toasties.,740,,,
ggarner4,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Please return Post Toasties Cereal to us. None other will do. - Gail Garner,740,,,
Old Cop,0,"Post Toasties had a much better flavor than that popular corn flake cereal that remains on the store shelves. I don't know when Post stopped making their cereal, I just know that it disappeared from the shelves a number of years ago. Too bad. If I could buy them again I would throw my current box into the trash.",740,,,
Roy A.,5,"Loved Post Toasties, also love Post Raisin Bran. Ate many a truck load, but then Post Toasties disappeared... what a shame. In my opinion, all the others look and taste alike... junk. Just an old man's thoughts.",740,,,
TEX,4,"ADMIT IT, all the former Post Toasties are now going into Honey Bunches Of Oats. Probably more profit there.",740,,,
graham,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I had them in South Africa from about 1942. They had airplane paper cut-outs on the box to make planes. The cereal and the planes made my days! Like lots of others, I would like them back. Kellogg's are a very poor competitor I am afraid. - Vic Fry",740,,,
Hooked,5,"I ate Post Toasties for breakfast all the time as a kid (giving away my age). I loved them. Then somewhere in the 2010-2011 time frame, I found Post Toasties in a Wegmans just north of Chicago in Michigan. I got hooked on them all over again. Then they disappeared once more. Bring them back, PLEASE! I love them - better than any cereal made now. I eat very little cereal now, but I'd have Post Toasties everyday if they sold them.",740,,,
ducky,5,"Favorite cereal since childhood, along with Rice Krinkles and I guess both are now discontinued. I don't understand why these are unavailable, yet all those other yucky cereals fill the shelves. I WANT MY POST TOASTIES BACK! The only brand worth eating!",740,,,

Yabbie,5,Loved them as a kid and wish they would come back.,740,,,
Mad Rhonda,5,"I am mystified about what has happened to Post Toasties. Even on their web page, in the history section, I see no listing for Post Toasties. There is only Kellogg's (yuck) and store brand flakes. Really? There is NOTHING like a good bowl of Post Toasties and milk. Please bring it back.",740,,,
Sonya C.,5,"What the heck? I thought they brought these back but I cannot find them anywhere. Other corn flakes don't even taste like they've been toasted at all. Please increase the stocking on these best corn flakes ever, Port Toasties!!!",740,,,
Robert in TX,5,"Never heard of a company dropping a line it made a profit on. Guess the price of corn may be the issue, now that so much is used for bio-fuels. But, it is our loss. No other cornflake has the crispiness and flavor of Post Toasties - the definition of what a corn flake should be.",740,,,
Dee,5,"How can a product that's far superior to any other offered be discontinued? Who makes these decisions? Post Toasties were the best cornflake cereal ever made, couldn't be beat. Please consider bringing them back to the market ASAP.",740,,,
Tex Me,5,"I truly miss my Post Toasties! Good anytime of day... loved them most as an evening snack... and they made the best corn-flake, peanut-butter treats! I hardly visit the cereal aisle anymore. :(",740,,,
MissKat,0,"I searched high and I searched low, but no Post Toasties could be found. I kept thinking they'd re-appear. There is no other corn flake worth buying.",740,,,
corvetteguy,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Is there a lawsuit against Post Toasties? If not, bring it back. Kellogg's is not the same. Surely Post Toaties has better recognition than many others! - Ron",740,,,
Miss Toasties,5,I miss Post Toasties. I will NOT eat ANY Post cereal until they bring it back!,740,,,
Like The Name,4,I love Post Toasties... but only because of the name. They're just corn flakes. They all taste the same.,740,,,
birdman,5,"Post Toasties was briefly re-introduced to the market a few years ago, and I wish I had stockpiled a supply. Nowhere to be found now. Beats Kellogg's Corn Flakes hands down.",740,,,

penny,5,"My husband will not eat any of the corn flakes I have been able to find since Post Toasties went out of production. Please return them to our shelves!

andrew,5,I say bring this back because it is crisper than Kellogg's. Honey Bunches of Oats rules!,372,,,
Peachy,5,"Best corn flakes ever... Kellogg's is junk food... when they have a winner, why would they quit making it? Please bring it back... I'm 87 years old. Don't have a lot of time to wait, hurry! I remember the commercial way back. It went: Post Toasties, heap good corn flakes... the best thing that's happened to corn since the Indians discovered it, heap good corn flakes. Post Toasties heap good corn flakes.",372,,,
OhioBirdLady,5,I'll join the 'Bring Back Post Toasties' Movement. Definitely the best!,372,,,

jilbert,0,"All, even the organic, corn flake cereals are full of sugar and you cannot even taste the corn! PLEASE BRING BACK the hearty Post Toasties! The real breakfast of champions! And besides, they always made the BEST CORN FLAKE TREATS, too!",372,,,
Spud,5,Toasties had the best taste. Please bring them back.,372,,,
ToastiesYum,5,"I found that Great Value flakes seems fairly similar. I wonder if this is Wal-Mart's doing... they just got Post to make the Oreo cereal again. Possibly they are so powerful, they just said ""Hey Post, make our corn flakes and don't make your own anymore. Mwahahaha"" and Post said ""Let us have some to put in Honey Bunches please!"" and Wal-Mart said ""Okay."", and Post said ""Thank you for letting us live your Royal Majesty!"".",372,,,
Postman,5,I've said it before and I'll say it again. These are my favorite corn flakes.,372,,,
Lee-7,5,I think this is probably the best cereal I've ever eaten. Please bring it back.,372,,,
tylermikp,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Post Toasties were by far the best. They were my go-to cereal for making breading for fish, chicken and pork. Now they are gone and I am left with nothing good. Bring them back!",372,,,

Dee-7,5,"Post Toasties Corn Flakes are the best cereal and there is no other cereal on the market that is a substitute. Since we must resort to picking them out of the Honey Bunches of O's, Post must still be making the Post Toasties to add to that cereal. Please Post, re-look at making a whole box of Post Toasties. I can guarantee you will sell more than before as many of us will buy them by the case so we don't run out in case the production would stop again.",372,,,
brngbcktoasties,5,Best cereal ever! Kellogg's flakes SUCK! Please bring it back. I'm resorting to picking the flakes out of Honey Bunches of Oats to get a bowl of Toasties. Give me a manufacturing facility and the recipe and I will make it for all their loyal customers.,372,,,
PostToasted,5,"While I didn't eat Toasties often, when I got a taste for them, nothing else would suffice. Kellogg's Corn Flakes don't even come close. Toasties flakes were thicker and thus stood up better in milk. Even when milk-saturated, Toasties had a certain body to them, where Kellogg's just turn to mush. I've had a taste for Toasties lately and am disappointed that they are no longer available.",372,,,
Postman,5,I loved Post Toasties corn flakes. Would love to see the original recipe come back.,372,,,
Dennis,5,"Post Toasties were absolutely without equal. Yes, bring them back!",372,,,

Max2001,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My mother, aged 97, wants her beloved Post Toasties cereal. I foolishly looked for this stuff every time I went to the store.

R.S. Rhodes,5,Please bring back Post Toasties brand of corn flakes. They were better than Kellogg's and always seemed a few cents cheaper too.,372,,,

silvertop2,2,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I loved Post toasties back in the 60s and 70s. We moved to a small town and neither of the two stores had them. We went each week to a larger town to buy them. One of the local stores started getting them for us. Then they changed the corn flakes to a new taste. They wouldn't soften up in milk. I tried a box and didn't like them. We bought a few more and finally gave up. They tasted about like stale Kellogg's corn flakes. I started getting Kellogg's and finally began to like them, but never like the Post brand. I wish they had done like coke and sold a classic kind that still tasted like they always had. I still start each morning with corn flakes, but sadly, not Post.",372,,,
cat love in MN,5,I can't believe they aren't making Post Toasties anymore. I refuse to buy Kellogg's Corn Flakes - Post Toasties were much better.,372,,,
wrmouton,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Surprised to see so many other people craving the original Post Toasties corn flakes. I can't find them anywhere. They are without doubt the best tasting cereal. I think poor to no advertising is the reason Post Toasties are not found in stores.,372,,,
Chris Kristofer,4,"I personally have not ever eaten Post Toasties, although I might know it as I was too young then, but I, myself, find Kellog's Corn Flakes just to be so so, etc... There seems to be even documented proof here to that opinion from many others. I should also like to make a good breakfast recommendation for those who are not aware of an excellent Icelandic recipe or tradition which is a bowl of corn flakes topped first with a layer of Friendship brand cultured buttermilk (no other brand will come close, trust me) and then a good sprinkling of brown sugar on top... This is a to-die-for treat. Even most kids go for this, again trust me on this.",372,,,

jaycar,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  My husband asked me to check on the internet to see where we could find Post Toasties because we have looked in every grocery store that we shop at and I thought the grocers just weren't stocking Post Toasties for some reason.

chippen2,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I didn't know Post Toasties corn flakes had been discontinued! I thought my regular grocer had discontinued them.

Miss M. Bad,5,Please please please bring them back.,372,,,
Gogo,5,"Post Toasties have always been on my cereal shelf, because after you have tried many of the new varieties, you always come back to Post Toasties. They are the most versatile of all cereals, either mixed with other cereals, or by themselves, or simply with milk and fruit. Nobody makes corn flakes as delicate and pleasant tasting as POST TOASTIES. They are what makes Honey Bunches cereals taste so good. Please bring them back! Gerald in Newark California",372,,,

Cereal lover,5,"If they would bring it back with some type of advertising to let people know, and the stores actually carry it, I think it would sell.

Woody13years,5,I am sorry to hear that Post Toasties are no longer being sold. I have looked for several years to find them without success. They were far superior in texture and taste to their rival Kellogg's. They did not seem to be widely distributed at least to Colorado. Could that have led to their poor sales?,372,,,

Maryliz,5,Product 19 is about the only cereal we will buy. If it isn't available we try to get one that is as close to the same as possible. The flakes have a nice taste and they stay crisp in milk longer than other flakes.,284,,,
Vince,5,"One of my favorite adult cereals - not loaded with sugar or crazy flavors. I've loved this since I was a child. Taste and texture keep me coming back, if I can find it.",284,,,
mygirlre,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I have eaten Product 19 for years a few times a month. In January 2014, I started a diet called Loseit and for 29 days a month I have had Product 19 for breakfast and also every night for a snack. I have eggs the other 2 mornings a month. I've lost 70 pounds. It gets me through my mornings.",284,,,
Kenny3,5,"*** solution found *** I ordered it as a special order at my local Publix. It took 2 weeks, but I got a great deal for just $4.99 per box. I bought 10 because we all eat it at home.",284,,,
Surreal cereal,5,It makes me feel like I'm 19 again!,284,,,
M.L.G.,5,Please bring it back! I have loved this cereal for over a decade! There is no substitute for this healthy and tasty cereal!,284,,,
austin72,5,Best cereal going. Very disappointed it is no longer readily available.,284,,,
Weeze,5,Don't ever stop making Product 19!!!,284,,,
ladysable,5,"I'm not a fan of this cereal, but my mother eats this everyday. She is 82 years old and has been eating this cereal since I was a little girl (1964). Publix stopped carrying this item and she was in panic mode and was going to all the Pubix's to see if anyone still had them on the shelf. I finally found it on Amazon and she gets a case delivered to her every month. Not sure what she loves about this cereal, to me it taste like a vitamin, but as long as mommies happy, I'm happy! She loves it!",284,,,
tex,5,Please bring back Product 19 to the retail stores!,284,,,
GARY JENSEN,5,"I am a healthy 65 year old male and have never had a serious illness. I attribute this partly to the fact that I have been addicted to Product 19 since 1970. Typically I eat a box of it per day along with a half gallon of milk. This product satisfies my craving for both solid food and deserts. I still can't get enough of it. Taste-wise, none of the other so-called healthy cereals can hold a candle to it. It stays crunchy while you are eating it. ONLY PROBLEM... can't buy it at retail stores, just through Amazon. For us aging boomers this is - by far - their best product. PLEASE get it back into stores.",284,,,
Scott K.,5,"I don't like any healthy cereal, but I liked this one until the day I couldn't get it anymore.",284,,,
Ernie,4,"I've never bought Product 19 on it's own, but I remember having it as part of the Variety Assortment. A fine tasting cereal.",284,,,
19rocks,0,You can still buy Product 19 on Amazon.,284,,,
Princelee72,5,Wonderful cereal! My mom loves it too. Hard to find now... What The Heck Kellogg's?! SIGH! Fix this issue. Who is your marketing person? Reevaluate that person! Now where is my Product 19?,284,,,
Megster,5,"I can't find this in Jefferson City, MO anymore - been to more than 6 grocery stores. Where can I buy this?",284,,,
Nick,5,Product 19 is undoubtedly the best cereal on the market! Just can't find it anywhere... not even Kroger's carry this cereal... now what?,284,,,
lakehouse,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I love this cereal. I have been eating it since 1969. I do not know why it is getting more and more difficult to buy. Stores such as Harris Teeter, Publix, Shoprite, Food Lion, Target, Bloom, to name a few do not carry Product 19 anymore. Why? Kellogg's Marketing are you listening? You can reach me via jjrslake@yahoo.com. Where can I buy Product 19?",284,,,
Caroline,5,Been eating it since I was old enough for solid foods. I am 21 now and still LOVE this cereal.,284,,,
T.J.,5,I suddenly cannot get it at Walmart and am sad about it.,284,,,
Jes K,1,My mother used to get this and MADE us eat it. The box would have been tastier than the nasty cardboard flakes inside. BLECH!,284,,,
ageless kid,0,Dennis James first introduced this cereal on TV in 1967. Will someone PLEASE put his Product 19 commercial on YouTube?,284,,,
Al A. Bama,5,"I was surprised when I spotted this cereal at Walmart last year. First I found it at a Chicago area supermarket near my hotel and brought it home when I returned to Alabama, a while later... I ordered the cereal from HOMETOWN FAVORITES. Now, Product 19 is at Walmart. I should thank THEM.",284,,,
Eric,4,The only place I can still find Product 19 is Walmart.,284,,,
spongey,5,"I know its not a popular cereal (as it just recently has stopped being stocked in my area, Chicago, not a small area) but this was my all time favorite cereal, bar none... glad I can at least still order it online... but for how much longer? I wish this fad of lightly sweetened flavored mixes would end soon.",284,,,

Mommycook,5,"Best ingredient cereal. Lots of people with an intolerance to certain foods can eat things with this in it. Also a great savory snack food. Miss it sooooo much!

No Sugar,5,"Malt-O-Meal Puffed Rice and Puffed wheat were the only cold cereals among hundreds on the shelves without sugar additives. For a diabetic, they were not only delicious, but healthy. Healthy cereals are dropped and unhealthy ones added. Bad choice, Malt-O-Meal.",288,,,

a.b.,1,Blah... These were so horrid. The bag they came in tasted better.,288,,,
Joe Spliggins,2,YUK! Nothing like a heaping bowl of styrofoam to start your day! Five minutes in milk and they turned from styrofoam to rubber. Not enough sugar in Cuba to make these taste good!,288,,,

maimiesmimma,5,My mother has eaten this every day for 50 or 60 years. And now she can't find it anywhere! This was a great cereal! Small and soft... made it great for people with dental issues.

There are enough of us here complaining?!,290,,,

Kate,5,"What did they do to the puffed rice recipe? I purchased 3 boxes yesterday and was horrified at the texture and flavor. I have been eating puffed rice since I was a kid and am 66 years old. The 3 boxes I recently purchased do not taste at all like the puffed rice I know and love... and the box was filled with powder. Now, I am used to some powder being on the bottom of the box as it is on all cereals, but this was awful. I threw the box away. I did notice the box changed. It is all red now instead of red and blue but the contents was just awful. What did they do to the recipe?!",290,,,

Pittsburgh M.,0,"HELP! Mother used these in the '30s and '40s in the fall each year. Puffed Rice Balls, as I recall now at 85 years, were the best treat of my youth. Anyone with suggestions of that era how-to-make 'em will sure do me a favor. Please.",290,,,

Gamelyn Chase,4,Tesco USED TO stock it! Sainsbury's still do - own brand. Why this corporate aversion to the product? It surely can't be the ''storage factor'' - all standard breakfast cereals take up much the same space in a warehouse.,694,,,
Jb,5,Please bring back Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice. I love those cereals. The best. I been eating this since a long long time. And I haven't for a long time... months. I have searched for them. And I found this to beg for them to bring them back. Just repackage them and advertise them as organic and bingo and they will sell. Thank you. - Jacki,694,,,
Postman,5,I cannot find Quaker Puffed Wheat or Rice and do not ever remember seeing Kellogg's Puffed Wheat. One of the stores I shop at now carries the store brand of puffed wheat and rice. It's not as good but is better than nothing. It is in a bag not box.,694,,,

May,5,"Warehouse suppliers control what is on your grocery shelf. You can buy puffed wheat and puffed rice by case on internet. That is a lot of cereal for one person, before it goes stale. I shared my order with my brother. He died two years ago. Have not found anyone since to share with.",694,,,
cerealkiller,4,"In view of some of the comments here. I fancied some puffed wheat. Imagine my surprise when I found out that it was unavailable at Tesco and maybe other stores as well. I have just been in touch with Tesco as to why they no longer sell puffed wheat as I had bought it from them in the past. It was a staple cereal throughout my life, (nearly 80). The young lady (21) I spoke to had never heard of it but had heard of sugar puffs, and could not find it on her system but said she would be on a mission to track it down. It has become an endangered species. What is the world coming to? A petition to bring it back is needed or a march on parliament. No ts in Submission.",694,,,
Grammie,0,I agree. PLEASE BRING BACK PUFFED WHEAT. My 93 yr. old husband's (diabetic) favorite cereal. Can't find it anywhere. Please let me know if you know where I can buy or order cereal.,694,,,
Monte Montana,5,"My husband and I grew up on PUFFED WHEAT - now it is almost impossible to find - when you do find it, it is a product of some company I never heard of and that makes me wonder about 'FLOOR SWEAPINGS'. Also we want the ORIGINAL PUFFED WHEAT, NO SUGAR ADDED. OMG, what is this thing with adding all this sugar to everything we eat. Please, I'd rather see this healthy cereal on the store shelves than the hundreds of toxic sugary alternatives - it also appears from previous comments from other consumers that we are not alone in wanting the original PUFFED WHEAT to return. My older brother would like this cereal, he's a diabetic and he enjoys PUFFED WHEAT too. Thanks for letting me air my feelings. PUFFED WHEAT FAN IN WINCHESTER, VIRGINIA",694,,,

Jennifer,5,My favorite cereal of ALL TIME! I wish they would bring it back.,383,,,
LaGuy,5,Loved it (but not nearly as much Jean LaFoote's Cinnamon Crunch from Cap'n Crunch).,383,,,
meany723,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Where can I find Vanilly Crunch cereal?,383,,,
Captain,5,This was the best cereal of all time. Just seeing pics of the boxes makes my mouth water.,383,,,
Bardamu,5,"For the love of God, bring it back!",383,,,

vanilly,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I can still remember this taste! My favorite cereal! Loved this and still crave it today! Please bring it back!,383,,,
Anonymous G.,5,Absolutely agree with the comments and I'm really surprised of it's short life and that it has not been brought back in over 40 years. All about marketing I guess?,383,,,
madd russian,5,Awesome cereal! I miss it bad!,383,,,
Goto,5,It was my favorite cereal. I would love to have a bowl before my big dirt nap. Please bring it back.,383,,,
JimiMack,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My two favorite cereals, Vanilly Crunch and OJ's, both vanished never to return. I still see Caramel Popcorn Crunch on the market, which I won't even attempt to try. I see Vanilla Life, Vanilla Special K and many other products flavored with vanilla. Even a Vanilla Latte Pop-Tart. I'm guessing that Cap'n Crunch people don't think Vanilla cereal will sell.",383,,,
CallMeSam,5,This is the only cereal I would buy regularly... bring it back!,383,,,
Scott8,5,My favorite cereal ever! Quaker - please bring it back.,383,,,
White Whale,5,Please bring it back!,383,,,
Piper-2,0,Bring it back! Other brands are bringing back their retro products. Even if it's just a promotion for a limited time only.,383,,,
stewie dark,5,"Interesting how Cap'n Crunch has made a multitude of cereals over the years, but has failed to bring back THE greatest one of them all - Vanilly Crunch! Also interesting how no one on the internet has come up with a petition to have Quaker bring back it's greatest product.",383,,,
Captain N.,5,My all time favorite! Would LOVE to see it return one day before I croak.,383,,,
jim-11,5,Bring it back!,383,,,
StickUp4Breakfa,5,Best. Cereal. Ever. Jean LaFoot's Cinnamon Crunch was pretty amazing as well.,383,,,
Kimberly P,5,Please bring Vanilly Crunch back. It was awesome.,383,,,
ataylor08,0,I first tasted this cereal when it was introduced back in 1971/1972. I was 5 or 6 years old and loved everything Cap'n Crunch. At the top of that list was Vanilla Crunch and to this day I remember it as my all time favorite -- even above the original Cap'n Crunch cereal. I'm stunned that it was never re-introduced. I've been waiting 40 years.,383,,,
Kathy-5,5,I though this was THE BEST cereal! I have friends that agree. We miss it and wish they would bring it back!,383,,,

OneMoreTime,5,People go nuts over the retro revival cereals. Bring this back for a couple months and everyone wins!,383,,,
Bruzr,5,Loved Vanilly Crunch! Please bring it back!,383,,,
sp32780,5,Best cereal ever created! Maybe not by man but from a Higher Power... the Cap'n himself. I was 8 and refused to eat cereal until Cinnamon Life came out but even its earthly goodness can't compare to this cereal.,383,,,
J Rock,5,"A top-five all-time cereal for me. This and Quisp and it's remarkable the idiots at Quaker Foods who don't pull off a retro promo, let's say once a year instead of coming up with same old ideas with Cap'n Crunch. $$$$$$ Morons.",383,,,
Robnoxious,2,Bleccch!,383,,,
Sabrina,5,I want this cereal to come back! It was the best cereal ever.,383,,,
Marky,5,My favorite cereal as a kid. Would be nice to see it back again. As long as the taste is the same.,383,,,
Ernie,4,The taste of this cereal during it's time on the shelves won over a chocolate lover like me! Let's hope the Cap'n brings back Vanilly Crunch one day.,383,,,
Remember When,5,Great taste! Great cereal! Great memories!,383,,,
Frankenberry65,5,They SERIOUSLY need to bring this back. I'm constantly telling them that on their Facebook page. maybe if we get enough people to request it...,383,,,

kenj,5,I love this cereal too. I am allergic to chocolate so I loved that I could have this cereal... Please please bring it back.,383,,,
fatman,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  One of the best things to eat when you had the munchies.,383,,,
oldlady504,5,I loved this cereal back when it first came out... would love to see it again... are they making it again? I can't wait for that great taste.,383,,,
jeep,5,@ SmokedHam - I do the exact same thing! I loved that stuff!,383,,,
SillyVanilly,5,I have been waiting for Vanilly to come back. I used to eat it right out of the box! No milk needed.,383,,,
SmokedHam,0,"Please bring it back. I loved it. I still, to this day, look for it when I go to the store hoping they brought it back.",383,,,
F.O.X.,5,Vanilly Crunch is my vote for the the Best Cereal Ever! Bring it back!,383,,,
nyc4life,5,"Please bring it back. This was the best tasting cereal in the world. Come on Cap'n, you're always bringing out limited edition cereals. Why not go retro?",383,,,
Chrisco,5,Bring it back! At least for a limited time. My kids are fed organic but I would make an exception for this treat from my childhood.,383,,,
vanilly lover,5,I can still remember the vanilla flavor and still crave it years later. Would definitely buy some if they made it again.,383,,,
rebel,5,I loved this cereal!,383,,,
RSL,5,"Wow. I not only remember the cereal, but I actually remember this exact prize. I haven't thought about this in decades... I wonder when that was - maybe something like 1975 or 1977? As I remember it, this was a great cereal. I'm sure if I tried it now it would taste really bad. I've built it up.",383,,,
joe55,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Were is Vanilly Crunch? How could they stop making the best tasting cereal I have ever tasted. Bring it back please.,383,,,
Sonic,5,"BRING IT BACK!!! One of my top 3 cereals, Why captain Why?",383,,,
j.b.,5,"Just about the best cereal ever. Of course it wasn't that good for you nutritiously speaking, but it sure tasted great. I still eat the regular and peanut butter Cap'n Crunch (never liked crunchberries that much) every once in awhile and I'm in my early 50's now. If they brought the ""Blue Box"" stuff back, you could count me in as a regular customer.",383,,,
Greger,5,Please bring it back! There was none other like it!,383,,,
Mike,5,This was the best cereal I ever had. I practically lived on the stuff. I still mourn it's removal from the Cap'n Crunch line-up.,383,,,
Fresh,5,The best cereal I ever ate as a kid. I cried the day my mom went to buy more and there was none left on the shelves.,383,,,
carr61,4,(Team Breakfast Member)  Loved it!,383,,,
moonblake,5,I was trying to remember the vanilla cereal I loved as a kid and wallah here it is. We need to start writing general mills to get them to bring it back.,383,,,
mumford,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I LOVED this cereal, but no one seemed to remember it but me! I wish they would bring it back - I could eat it every day.",383,,,
robertn201,5,Please give me information and bring it back. robertn201@yahoo.com,383,,,
spaceace,5,This and Quisp were my favorites!!! Bring it back!!,383,,,
BB11CBS,5,This was the best Captain Crunch cereal ever. They should bring it back even if only for a limited time.,383,,,
Hammertime,0,This is/was my all-time favorite breakfast cereal. PLEASE bring it back the grocery store shelves for a retro run.,383,,,
John,5,This is the best cereal ever!! The only person I know that remembers this cereal is my wife. I can still remember the taste of the cereal today!!!,383,,,
christopher,5,This was my favorite. Wish they had it now. If u eat regular crunch with vanilla milk the taste comes close. The taste memory came back.,383,,,
They were wrong,5,"Thank you for this webpage. You have vindicated my childhood memories. Whenever I spoke of Vanilla Cap'n Crunch to my siblings, and the whale on the box, I was told I was crazy. I was 3 at the time and still remember that damn box of cereal, down to the colr and the coupon.",383,,,

JSH,4,Box says 'imported by Kellogg's Canada in Mississauga Ontario'. Imported from where?,384,,,
Abe C.,5,Amazing.,384,,,
Katya,5,Where can I get it in the US?,384,,,
SuperSenior,5,"Have eaten Vector 5 days a week with a banana & skim milk, since it was introduced 20 yrs. ago, the only cereal that doesn't get soggy before you can finish eating it. Have never found it on our travels in USA. Does the nutrition claims not pass FDA muster, is it sold in Mexico or elsewhere on the planet, or exclusively to health conscious Canucks?",384,,,
Erik,5,"Tried this in Canada years ago, don't really recall precisely why. Was hooked in an instant: crunchy, slightly sweet, touch of cinnamon. Luckily I live minutes from Canada in the US, but I can't understand why they've never tried selling it here. Stays crunchy in milk, tastes great, somewhat healthy. Just got like 10 more boxes on the last trip. Gonna be interesting if border patrol stops me and finds a bunch of Vector one of these days.",384,,,
E.J. Rebel,5,"This cereal is SO AWESOME, people! If you haven't tried it, you're missing out.",384,,,
shinka,5,Super boosting cereal. I take 1 1/4 cup with a banana and unsweetened almond milk... The bomb!,384,,,
Gee,3,Why is there BHT in Vector? I was disappointed to see that. I will think twice before I buy it again.,384,,,
drury,3,"It's interesting for me. I really like the first few bowls, but then it loses some of its appeal. Still, it's a great bargain, especially when it's on sale.",384,,,
jimcarry,1,(Team Breakfast Member)  I find Vector cereal to be absolutely terrible.,384,,,
cplbaldwin,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Vector cereal is awesome! Not only is it delicious and nutritious, it boosts me with much needed vitamins and carbs to help me train for my marathon and have marathon love sessions with my British hottie.",384,,,
Capt. Planet,5,"Vector cereal is the best thing that's ever happened to my life. 10 years ago - I lost my prized tortoise in a sailing accident and it devastated me. I didn't know where to turn but Vector cereal was always there for me, whenever I would feel sad I would get a fresh bowl of Vector and it would raise my spirits tenfold and I would be filled with love for all creatures of the world. It also has 13 grams of protein for when I lift things up and put them down.",384,,,
trudy,5,"Great crunch and very filling. I add banana, almonds and almond milk.",384,,,
Franco,5,"This cereal is very good and I miss it. I am in the USA, Florida now and I can't get it. Why?",384,,,
lorac,0,Love this cereal! My breakfast every morning is a bowl of Vector cereal with a half-cup of yogurt and a tablespoon of honey. This is all I require to get my day started.,384,,,
Shirley,5,We are searching for this cereal here in Oregon; tried it in B.C. when we were visiting and really liked it. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.,384,,,
sardis,5,Really delicious... I like it.,384,,,
Beckster,5,"I eat this cereal for a snack food, it is awesome with or without milk, very satisfying!",384,,,
Ken,5,"I slice up a banana into a bowl of this cereal in the morning (my work week breakfast time is 5:30am) and it fills me up through lunch (12pm) without any need for between meal snacks. High in protein (5.5g per 1.25cup serving), fibre (2.7g), vitamins, and minerals. It's only flaw can be the 11g of sugar per serving though I assume that is to offset the taste of all the added vitamins/minerals. And it does have a high ratio of carbs to protein with much of the carb being of the simple variety. The taste is pleasant although the granola clusters can tend to be a bit hard. At least the cereal holds up well in milk unlike Honey Bunches of Oats where the flakes turn into a soggy mess instantly. Vector is part of my rotation of cereals since I get bored of any one kind after one box. It's a good cereal for me since I cannot stand the taste and texture of Mini-Wheats that everyone seems to love.",384,,,
BestBuddy,5,This cereal was a bit hard.,384,,,

YJ,5,The best cereal ever made!!!,387,,,

Darrell in SLC,4,Would I be crazy if I suggested that Waffelos was the same recipe as Freakies just rebranded and repackaged?,387,,,
Johnny X.,5,"This was one of my favorites as a kid. I remember it tasting both maple-y and buttery. Like good waffles. If Waffelos came back today, I'd probably buy it every week.",387,,,

Brian Katcher,0,"I swear to God, I had a nightmare about that commercial when I was a child.",387,,,
Holly T.,5,Best cereal of all time! I just wished Ralston would make it again! I would buy it direct from the manufacturer by the case - many cases at a time.,387,,,
DixieKen,5,"When I developed Type One Diabetes at aged 10 in 1981, I cried to my mother ""You mean I'll never get to eat Waffelos again?"" Horrible thing for a little kid, but she still let me have small amounts occasionally. Man I loved this cereal!",387,,,
Tim Sheahan,5,This stuff was like crack!,387,,,
Old West Dave,5,"I LOVED Waffelos when I was a kid. I don't understand why someone doesn't bring this cereal back.

C. Carver,5,Please bring Waffelos back! I can still taste the maple flavor. It was so good!,387,,,
Azskyart,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Waffalos cereal was the best. Nothing on the market compares to it. They need to bring it back and watch the sales go up.

We miss buffalo Bill. -Butch,387,,,

Banquo,5,"I never knew anyone who didn't love these, I can't imagine why they every got rid of them, they HAD to sell well. Waffle Crisp is ""OK"" but it's not as good as Waffleos were. BRING THEM BACK!!!",387,,,

stockworthy,5,I wish this cereal was still for sale. It's still my favorite of all time.,387,,,

69,5,Oh oh oh flashbacks... I remember eating this cereal. It was good too.,387,,,
heathersand,5,I actually totally forgot about Waffleos until I saw them here. I remember loving the Maple while my little brother was more fond of the Blueberry. Some of the best-tsting cereal ever!,387,,,
chip88,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  So good it made my teeth hurt!,387,,,
schweet,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I remember the maple flavor tasting very real. It was almost as if syrup was drizzled over Captain Crunch pieces. It was delicious. I miss it.,387,,,

campbell,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I can actually taste this cereal when I look at the box. Egg-o cereal was close in flavor, but not as good. Is this one gone forever? I miss it.",387,,,
ShyGuy,5,This is my favorite cereal of all time. I still have a glow in the dark sticker from Waffelos that went over a light switch.,387,,,
Maple-man,5,"I loved waffelos. The stickers that came in the box must have had some super adhesive, because we had a sticker of the horse I put on our dishwasher door for about 10 years.",387,,,
Bennett,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I lived for this cereal. It was the reason I woke up every morning. I miss you Waffelos! The blueberry version was great too.,387,,,

Tai Hoota,0,"I agree with all of the comments. They must have sprinkled this cereal with crack cocaine because it was simply the bomb! I wish I had a storm cellar back in the 80's, I would have filled it with Blueberry Waffelos before they went out of business on us.",917,,,
Caine,5,"The best cereal I had as a child, now let me find Boo Berry.",917,,,
edricky,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  OMG!! The Blueberry Waffelo Bill joints is my Worlds Fav Cereal... WOW I'd do anything for just one more Bowl. And another thing I may add is they were very high in fiber. That worked for me. I was regular.,917,,,
Warlocke,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This stuff was delicious and, at the time, the only blueberry flavored cereal I'd had. For some reason, my brother and I weren't allowed to have Boo-Berry, back then, and I can only assume it's because my mother unfairly assumed it was more sugary and dye-filled than it actually was. The only downside to Waffelos (other than the blueberry version making the maple version an utterly superfluous also-ran, by default) was that if you lingered too long over a bowl, in addition to the cereal getting soggy, the milk would get a sort of scummy film on the top. Food and I have an uneasy relationship, so when my sister showed up at breakfast with one of those clear, peel-off, gel masks on her face, making it look like her flesh was melting, and I looked down at the film on my milk, it put me right off my cereal. I couldn't bring myself to eat Waffelos for a long time after that, and by then they had vanished from store shelves. Still, one of the more memorably delicious cereals of my youth.",917,,,
ToonmanInSTL,5,"This was the BEST dang cereal on the planet! I'd give my left nut to have this back again! I'd probably hoard it like Elaine did the Today's Sponge, on Seinfeld!",917,,,
Zoey70,5,I absolutely loved this cereal as a kid. This was probably the best breakfast cereal I have ever eaten in my life.,917,,,
Kenzie,5,Loved them as a kid... both blueberry and maple. Wish they still made them.,917,,,
Landers,5,This is still (and always will be) my favorite cereal of all time. I wish like crazy that they still made them.,917,,,
mike71,5,Simply... the best!,917,,,
OldManWalkin,5,Best. Cereal. EVER!,917,,,
DJM1665,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  OMG! I used to eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And when my cousin moved in with us, oh it was a wrap. My mom would buy four to five boxes at a time. We liked maple, but we went crazy for BLUEBERRY! Nothing out there now compares! Please bring them back. Original formulas please!",917,,,
Nae CerealQueen,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I wish there was a way to order both flavors. I miss this cereal so much. I was able to order Quisp online. Just wish I could order this one.,917,,,
Rico S.,5,I use to love this cereal as a kid. This was one of my favorite breakfast cereals. Used to snack on theses after school while watching cartoons.,917,,,
dezkc,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I never forgot about this cereal. I've tried all the wanna be waffle cereals and none of them compare to this. I would definitely order a 30 year old box just because this was my favorite cereal ever! Lol! Please bring back and don't make any changes to it!,917,,,
U. Ryan,5,My ALL-TIME FAVORITE CEREAL! This is a REAL BLAST FROM THE PAST! I loved both Blueberry and the original! I can't understand why they stopped making it. All blueberry cereals now taste awful. Pieces of childhood GONE FOREVER!!!!,917,,,
Hyrum_Justice,5,"My favorite cereal EVER. Went to (West) Germany in the Army. When I came back Sambos restaurants and this cereal were gone:( leave for a little while, come back and nothing is the same. We need this back!",917,,,
AA6,4,Talk about a blast from the past! I loved this cereal.,917,,,
Totoro,5,Git along 'lil blueberry critters... ha... I totally remember the commercial for this cereal. The horse reminded me of Eeyore from Winnie The Pooh.,917,,,
T.G.I.,5,I use to love this stuff. Please bring it back! The maple flavor was really good too!,917,,,
Taylor,5,Never been a better blueberry cereal since. I also miss the original Maple Waffelos. Both really good cereals.,917,,,
chomp,5,This was my favorite cereal ever. How do I get some of this again?????,917,,,
Mr. Buddy,5,I had this cereal as a kid. It was very good. Haven't had a cereal like this since. The blueberry flavor was fantastic!,917,,,
hyperlunch,5,Tasted like Hubba Bubba blueberry gum. Perfection in a bowl. For serious.,917,,,

FatsILLmatic,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  They still sell Waffle Crisp at a Mars supermarket in Baltimore county. They also sell the Post Good Mornings Waffle Crunch at a near by super Wal-Mart.

cereal guy,5,"I bought a box of Wheaties at Hy-Vee East in Norfolk, Nebraska. It was good.",396,,,
Chip,5,"I am now in crisis! Although I have eaten Wheaties for 80 plus years and can't imagine living without them, it now appears I may have outlived the Battle Creek Wheaties machine. IT HAS BEEN OVER 3 WEEKS SINCE ANY SUPERMARKET IN SOUTHERN MAINE HAS HAD ANY WHEATIES IN STOCK. What's up? I will gladly return the 3 lovely sleeves of Wheaties golf balls I received for a few boxes of the product. Please don't tell me it is the end of the Wheaties era.",396,,,
nmls100,4,Loved it before my husband's celiac diagnosis.,396,,,
Biff,3,They should make a maple coated version of Wheaties for those people that still crave Buc-Wheats.,396,,,
longtimebreaker,2,How is this cereal still available and Post canceled production on Fortified Oat Flakes? Poor decision on Post's part. Never cared for Wheaties.,396,,,
Saville,2,"This cereal now has the texture and flavor of no brand generic cereal. Upon opening the bag, I sniffed for the Wheaties aroma and found none, then the disappointment of the taste told me I was eating something less than expected.",396,,,
Postman,5,Still a very good cereal.,396,,,
No Sugary Sweet,4,I really like Wheaties.,396,,,
Vince,5,"Tastes different than it did when I was a kid - not as heavy, missing some of the old malt flavor. Still better than most - if you can still find it among a sea of sweetened empty-calorie offerings.",396,,,
RNMando,3,"I grew up on Wheaties and thought they were amazing. Then someone at General Mills thought they should fix what wasn't broke and they introduced the ""New Wheaties"". Ugh! They now taste just like the rest of field. Oh how I long for the original cereal.",396,,,
Loved Wheaties,2,"Wheaties used to taste SO good. Somewhere since the 1970's, not sure when, they changed the recipe or something and today I get mad at myself every time I forget how bad they suck and accidentally buy another box. I called up General Mills to ask them how/why could they possibly ruin a perfect cereal. Today's Wheaties are not even comparable to the original Wheaties I remember. I would eat bowl after bowl of the old Wheaties. The new Wheaties reminds me of generic wannabe cereals. Yuk. Throw it away. It is worthless and it makes me think of shorting General Mills stock actually now that I think of it. There is no substitute for absolutely having the best product. They did before, but DEFINITELY do not now. Hard to believe actually.",396,,,
Bennett2,4,Where can I find out more about the tin auto emblems that were offered from Wheaties and what were the 31 auto companies that you could collect? Are there any pictures of each emblem and the promotional advertising for these? Appreciate any info you could supply me. - BENNETT@CONRADS,396,,,
larry,5,Loved Wheaties when I was young and it remains one of my favorites today.,396,,,
Postman,3,I think Wheaties and Total are the same cereal.,396,,,
monk,0,I was wondering if you found info on the 1934 Wheaties car. I have one and find very little about it and it's value. mjkins(at)comcast.net,396,,,
Avrige Bear,5,"About 20 years ago, I found that GENERAL MILLS was one of the sponsors for THE original MICKEY MOUSE CLUB in it's original network days in the 1950's. I also found that there used to be a MICKEY MOUSE CLUB cut out record on the front of each box. RIP Annette.",396,,,
T.B.,5,Great Cereal! A classic.,396,,,
rkade111,3,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Good but not great. It is far less interesting than Nabisco Team Flakes, which are now out of production. I would say that Wheaties are bland unless you add a bit of sugar... or fruit.",396,,,
k.s.,0,Can anyone tell me if General Mills changed the Wheaties recipe in the mid 1980s?,396,,,
CerealKId,0,I love those cereal boxes. Wheaties is the best. It made breakfast fun. I loved reading about all of the greatest athletes who ever played.,396,,,
Cincinnati Kid,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) With all of the great athletes who have appeared on the Wheaties box, what I easily recall is from the mid-1950's when the front of the box had a small state metal license plate that you got when you bought it. Later, the licenses were from other countries. When people started pulling the license plate off of the box without purchasing the product, the license was placed inside. I think the first license tag that I got was from Maryland (a black tag with gold lettering). The first country that I got was Turkey although it was spelled out using the Turkish alphabet.",396,,,
Jan,0,Hi - Does anyone have information about a circa 1934 Wheaties cereal premium for an American Flyer yellow toy boxcar? Any information would be much appreciated. Thank you. Jan,396,,,
ken,0,"The best thing I remember so much was Wheaties Bran with Raisin Flakes. That was such a good cereal. That happened in 1962 - 2 years later, it was changed to General Mills Bran and Raisin Flakes.",396,,,
Tenny,0,I just acquired a slumber bag/sleeping bag/comforter with this Wheaties tennis player box as the artwork on it. Is he a particular tennis player and what year do you think it was made? I am thinking 1960's.,396,,,
Doug,0,What a great collection! I just found one of these emblems for Plymouth on e-bay and received it this week. Wish I could find more for sale. Brings back memories collecting these from Wheaties when I was 6-8 years old.,396,,,
tatsataum,4,What is this - the History Channel? I need to know dietary info!,396,,,
vero,4,You should talk how this cereal can help you perform better at your sport. It will get more attention.,396,,,
Nelo,0,The 15.6 oz. cereal weight in the same size box as the former 18 oz. weight is decitful and cheating the consumer. You folks should be ashamed of yourselves! - Neil A. Austin (nelo2@verizon.net),396,,,

SPooKYLoTuS,5,"Now THERE ARE NO WHEATIES on shelves at all in the mid Florida area (Tampa Bay). We would load up on regular Wheaties at Walmart. My mom eats it to get down medicine, and I got hooked on them because they aren't all sugary and are good fiber etc. So, NONE at PUBLIX, or anywhere else we checked. I guess the government is not going to help out General Mills! IS THIS THE END FOR WHEATIES and all of its offspring?",1325,,,

May J.,5,This was the only cereal that was enjoyed by ALL my family. Can't believe they stopped making it. Wish I could express my disappointment to Quaker. But it's not on their website for comments.,1466,,,
sunbird,5,"I no longer eat breakfast. Because of the fat in eggs and the cholesterol, I used to eat Cheerios but when I tried whole hearts, I was hooked. Best cereal ever bar none. I can't stand Cheerios anymore and I have put no less than 24 boxes of different cereals in the garbage after one taste. I can't stand them. Please bring Whole Hearts back. They were the best ever.",1466,,,
Bess,5,"I'm so bummed they stopped selling this cereal. Everyone in my family LOVES it, especially me! Big mistake by Quaker if this is really gone forever.",1466,,,
ItsJustKK,5,"I've read that Whole Hearts is similar to Cheerios, but I cannot stand Cheerios and loved Whole Hearts, so of course it was discontinued.",1466,,,
bringbackHHnow!,5,I've been a healthy cereal connoisseur for many years and was extremely disappointed when I stopped seeing Whole Hearts on the grocery store shelves. Even more when I learned it was discontinued. It is obvious Quaker lacked time and marketing strategy for this cereal to have a chance to take off. It by far blasts Cherrios out of the milk when it comes to taste and nutrition. So sad when a company has such a great product but does not have the know how to get it into the mouths of the consumer. Millions if not billions of $ lost and a world of deprived cereal lovers.,1466,,,
janey,5,"The best cereal ever. The BEST. So of course, let's stop selling it? What is wrong with Quaker Oats? Just make it and people will buy it! Just look at the comments here. We love it. Big mistake.",1466,,,
gina g.,5,I also wish it would come back! Glad to see I'm not alone in missing this great cereal.,1466,,,
Salami,5,The best cereal ever bar NONE. So of course let's stop selling it? What the heck is wrong with Quaker Oats? Make it and people will buy it!,1466,,,
Luv Hearts,5,"I love this cereal. Why did they stop selling it? Is it because it is like the Kashi cereal with hearts, but less expensive?",1466,,,
Heart Broken,5,"I agree with all the other reviews - great cereal, please bring it back.",1466,,,
canuk,5,The best cereal ever bar NONE. So of course... let's stop selling it? What the heck's wrong with Quaker Oats? Make it and people will buy it!,1466,,,
squrt1184,5,Why did they stop selling this cereal. It is the only cereal our family really enjoys. All of us. I can't even voice our disappointment to Quaker. It is not on their website for comments.,1466,,,
Bean,5,"This cereal is delicious, but I'm totally unable to find it anywhere! Please get it back on the shelves at the grocery stores!",1466,,,
Tarbox,5,"Whole Hearts is the only cold cereal that my husband likes. We've been hunting all our local stores for months, and now see on this site that they've discontinued it! Why did they do that? Now what do we do?",1466,,,
Elizabeth,5,Whole hearts is a great cereal. I replaced my Cheerios. Must have it back. Breakfast is just not the same.,1466,,,
Ratatask,5,My 3 year old was sobbing this morning because we're almost out of Hearts and they've discontinued it. She won't eat anything else for breakfast. We've tried for months. I so wish they would bring it back.,1466,,,
SinclairBelcha,5,Please put Quaker Whole Hearts back in the stores. I was buying Whole Hearts on Amazon lately but this site also has stopped selling Quaker Whole Hearts.,1466,,,
Nick41,5,Please put Quaker Whole Hearts Cereal back in the stores. It is the best cereal ever made.,1466,,,
Garrett In L.A.,5,I can't find this cereal any more either and I didn't stock up enough boxes and now it's gone from the shelves. Beats all those flavors of Cheerios... help me find it.,1466,,,
W.I.P.,5,Best cereal ever had and I can no longer find it locally.,1466,,,
Sportmom,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I don't find many cereals tolerable let alone good, however, Whole Hearts became my favorite from my first bowlful with my Granddaughter. It is sweetened just right and stays crunchy and enjoyable from the first bite to the last several minutes later. Shame on Quaker for letting us down by eliminating it from their offerings! I'm so sad to see such a Great cereal go, can't imagine what I'll find to replace it. It would be nice if I could at least buy from the company direct!",1466,,,
momof1,5,My daughter loves this cereal but can no longer find it. It's out of stock everywhere. It should be readily available just like Cheerios.,1466,,,
quantum,0,(Team Breakfast Member) Why did Quaker take this cereal off the shelf? Please put it back. Buying the cereal on Amazon is expensive when the shipping costs are $10.00. My husband is gluten free and he really enjoys this cereal. Quaker shouldn't make it so difficult for us to buy the products we love.,1466,,,
Need My Hearts,0,I bought Whole Hearts cereal at Wal-Mart. They quit selling it then I bought it at Ingles and Kroger. Now they have quit selling it. Where can I buy it now?,1466,,,

bubblefish,5,"For those of you who can't find it anymore, go to quakeroats.com and there's a product locator to find in a store near you. I hate that Walmart no longer carries it! Maybe if a bunch of us request it, it will come back. LOVE this cereal... everyone in our family loves it!",1466,,,
cerealgirl,5,"I've been looking up, down and all over the place for this cereal and I can't find it! I have yet to know what has happened to it! Why can't we get any answers?",1466,,,
Farmer,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  My husband LOVES this cereal! He has the kids, their wives and now his siblings eating the cereal. We have hunted everywhere and can NO longer find this cereal! We want to know where to get it? We would purchase a case at a time if we only knew where to go! Can you Please let all of us know where to get it? - S. J. M.",1466,,,
spoonz22,5,Why can't find this cereal anyplace other than Wal-Mart lately?,1466,,,
Sawdust,5,"I live in Marshall,HIL, and have been buying Whole hearts at the Wal-Mart store here ever since the cereal came out. Suddenly, it is gone, and I am bereft. I have searched for it in stores in Terre Haute, IN, which is close to us, and I cannot find it there either. What has happened to it? I LOVE it and truly miss it. There is no substitute. Ann Bennet",1466,,,
honey,5,"We love this cereal and can no longer find it in NW Arkansas. I cannot have wheat and this one fits the bill and tastes good, as well. Please, bring it back to our area! Better than Cheerios that makes our mouths sore. We need it! It no longer is at Walmart or any of the stores in our area.",1466,,,
NY Jen,5,I love it. Better than Cheerios and less expensive.,1466,,,
Flipper,5,"I live in Vancouver BC Canada and we cannot find any of this cereal anywhere. We bought it before but now it is gone. We have tried Whole Foods, Safeway, Superstore and Save On. Where can we buy these please?",1466,,,
Pannie,5,"This is SO much better than Cheerios! It's the new favorite for everyone in my family, including the animals! No more dog treats, they want this! It's the base for the parrot's food too!",1466,,,
Gibbs,5,"I have not enjoyed cereal since I was a kid and my wife and I are now completely hooked, easily the best cereal there is!",1466,,,
Baileegirl,4,Very good & tasty.,1466,,,
Nutty D.,5,"Delicious, simple and healthy. They're like Cheerios, but I think just a little better.",1466,,,
SZA,5,This is the best new cereal I've come across in a LONG time. It's delicious - kind of like Cheerios but MUCH crunchier and just a tad sweet. The flavor is kind of like the oat pieces in Lucky Charms cereal. I love it! We always have a box in our cupboard now. :),1466,,,
JennyPoo,5,"Too yummy, can't stop eating it!",1466,,,
Elisa,5,"I've been eating this every morning since it first came out. It's really, really good.",1466,,,
Teacher in MI,5,"I discovered these at Kroger's in January. I work at a church pre-school and thought they'd be perfect for Valentine's Day for snack-time! I had to try them, first, of course, and ended up going back to the store for more. I plan on making Whole Heart Marshmallow treats for Valentine's Day, stringing them for necklaces, and, if any leftovers, just eating loosely at snack-time another day. I know my ""kids"" will love them. Perfect shape to put in many recipes for your loved ones. How about for a wedding shower? Use your imagination. They are yummy and good for you, too. Thank you.",1466,,,
K.C.,0,The pieces are cute and the taste is delicious! I approve!,1466,,,

My dad would go to his store and purchase 10 boxes at a time to bring to me whenever he visited. Eventually, he could no longer find it either.

I found a product at Winco in the bulk Isle that looked a lot like the Wheat Hearts. It was a multigrain cereal that is more coarsely ground. It was next to the farina and oatmeal cereals. I bought some and it really tastes like I remember the Wheat Hearts I liked so much. The only thing is - I do not have the directions from the Wheat Hearts on the portion sizes of water to cereal ratio to cook serving sizes. But it is really good. The next time I go to Winco foods I will get the exact name. I have also seen a multigrain cereal similar at SPROUTS stores, and at the health food store, but have not tried their cereals.",450,,,

BonnieK,5,"Hey Everyone, I read a comment online (elsewhere) about Greenfield Mills (Indiana) that makes a cereal which ""tastes just like Wheat Hearts"". I found the product, called Hearts of Wheat, at: newrinkelflour.com. Look up Hearts of Wheat in search, or click their shop online button. Problem: they say they will now sell Hearts of Wheat seasonally, from Oct. 1 to June 1. I will phone them tomorrow to see whether they have any left. The cereal is not expensive, but shipping is a bit pricy, seems you might want to try a 4 pounder if shipping costs the same as the 2 pounder. I haven't tried it, but thought you Wheat Heart fans would sure want to know, even if you have to wait until October! I called and also wrote to General Mills when they quit making Wheat Hearts. They told me it wasn't a profit-maker. I told them it wasn't fair to not make one product that is good for people, when they were making lots of money on unhealthy stuff. I don't buy General Mills now. I sure hope this Hearts of Wheat is really good. - Bonnie",450,,,

My grandkids want this hot cereal their Mother talks about and still craves. My family would really love the chance to get this healthy delicious hot cereal.,450,,,
charlieann,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I found this in a few markets in AZ up until the early 1990's and we also found in Utah. When I called Gen. Mills they said they'd only ship to larger warehouses & wouldn't sell to private parties. I have a partial box in frzr I've been eating from for a year. It's great!! Please bring it back. Carol in A.J.,450,,,
herman hermit,5,Would be nice to get this product back on the market. It was a favorite of many of us kids from the 60's,450,,,
Elk Grove,5,"Where can I find Wheat Hearts or is it even made any more? Elk Grove, California",450,,,
Bob &amp; Jan,5,"Where can I buy Wheat Hearts (we live in Ocala, FL 34472)??? It's the best hot cereal going!!!",450,,,
oldpromoter10,5,"I miss Wheat Hearts, too, and with all the trend to ""natural"", ""wholesome,' ""healthful"", etc. if GM would reintroduce with a new ad campaign it'd make millions. (Take a tip from the Old Spice resurrection!)",450,,,
tekctrl,5,"We purchased a case of Wheat Hearts the last time we were on the west coast, shipped it to our home in IL, and put it in the freezer. We're down to our last two boxes,then... no more Wheat Hearts?!?!??? Please, GMills, this was one of the very few breakfast (the most important meal of the day) cereals that was really, truly good and good for us. Not sugar filled and loaded with preservatives and artificial coloring, processed into oblivion! You want more profits? Bring Back Wheat Hearts!!",450,,,
Nan,0,I have been looking for wheat hearts for a long time and am sorry to hear they don't have it anymore. Please bring it back. - JoAnn,450,,,
CatMoves,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I really miss Wheat Hearts. It was the only cereal that had TASTE. I mean it really tasted GOOD. And it's good for you, too. How can you beat a combination like that? PLEASE General Mills, bring Wheat Hearts back and bring it back AS IT WAS; no messing around with the original recipe.",450,,,
Barbara,5,"I have been missing this cereal for years. I really miss it from the grocery shelves, they even looked into it for me years ago. As a child I remember my mother giving it to me, also the hospital served it when I was a child.",450,,,
nejuma,4,"I ate and thoroughly enjoyed Sperry Wheat Hearts from childhood. They discontinued the cereal while I was living overseas in the military, and I've always missed it. I wish they'd manufacture it again. I'd be a staunch customer.",450,,,
get_57,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  How I wish they'd bring this cereal back. Not only was it a great hot cereal, I loved adding a bit to my pancake batter for some of the best pancakes ever!! I agree, there is none better!",450,,,
elmmerd,5,I really wish General Mills would bring Wheat Hearts back!!!,450,,,
LindaD,0,"(Team Breakfast Member) I can't believe some people never got to eat wheat hearts, they were the only hot cereal we cooked in our home, my mother before me, then me, then my children. Sad because nothing can replace them. Come on General Mills, bring them back!!",450,,,
CK,5,"Wheat Hearts was in a class by itself. I've tried many currently available hot cereals and find none has the robust wheat flavor and smoothness that Wheat Hearts had. If General Mills brings it back, I will buy it!",450,,,
scott_marsha,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I also grew up on Wheat Hearts as did my two boys that loved it. We lived all over the U.S. and Europe and when we couldn't find it anywhere my mom would mail it to us and to find out we can no longer get it is very sad and we miss it.,450,,,
Paloma,5,"Please G mills bring back wheat hearts. I need them to introduce to my grandbabies, Ovaltine is still here!",450,,,
walter,0,(Team Breakfast Member) Where can I buy Wheat Hearts cereal nowaday? Please let me know. Thanks.,450,,,
Pierre,5,I too share the sentiments of the other contributors to comments about one of my favorite breakfast dishes. I found a half dozen boxes of the delightful stuff at a flea market several years ago and bought them all and savored the yummy flavor for as long as they lasted. Please bring it back.,450,,,
snowmachineman,0,(Team Breakfast Member) If General Mills is truly interested in providing the healthiest foods then how could they stop producing Wheat Hearts? Show us what kind of a company you are and start producing and promoting Wheat Hearts as the NEW HEALTH breakfast food. Wes,450,,,
msmusical,5,"I, too, miss Wheat Hearts as do almost all the members of my immediate and extended family. Unlike other cooked wheat cereals, Wheat Hearts actually had a distinctive wheat flavor. The other hot wheat cereals are, well, just hot. No flavor whatsoever. It's my favorite cold weather cereal and if it were brought back in an ""instant"", single-packet presentation like the other hot cereals, I know it would be a successful seller again. I hope General Mills will consider bringing it back. We'll all be healthier for it.",450,,,
irishlady,5,"With all of the sugary, highly-colored, no-food-value cereals on the grocery store shelves, we lament the disappearance of Wheat Hearts! We need a few nutritious breakfast foods to balance all the garbage that is sold. Wheat Hearts was also just delicious, and not like any other cereal, so there is no substitute. Please, General Mills, bring Wheat Hearts back to our tables.",450,,,
james,5,"I miss wheat hearts, my all time favorite hot cereal. Mom made them for breakfast often. I'm 62 know and I still miss the great smell and taste. Sure be nice to see them back on the store shelves again. - James",450,,,
Bobbi,5,My favorite hot cereal. One of my fondest memories of staying with my grandmother as a child.,450,,,
Kitty,5,My husband and I love this cereal. Why did GM discontinue it? - Bev,450,,,
Tobydoby,5,What a sad event that such a fine product was discontinued. My mother served it often to us. I can still taste it 55 years later. A wonderful memory.,450,,,
Dee,5,I miss this cereal. It was one good memory from childhood.,450,,,

Phaedra47,5,"I loved Krumbles so much and have missed it all these decades. Decade after decade, and still wishing to be able to eat it again. Kellogg's is a huge company... I don't understand why they can't handle a little job like that; bring us Krumbles again! PLEASE!",778,,,
Steve,5,Wish I could buy it today. It was my favorite when I was a child.,778,,,
J.S.,5,I ate Krumbles as a kid. They really need to bring it back. I am now 70 and the little things in life are what matters. Krumbles was one of those things that gave us joy.,778,,,
joeg99,5,"Krumbles was my favorite! Yes, 'bring it back'! OK, the marketeers will have to find a way to differentiate it, a niche! Healthy and delicious!",778,,,
dana,1,"I remember this cereal from my childhood - utterly disgusting. It became instantly soggy when you poured milk on it and worst of all, a strange brown color immediately suffused the milk. Ick!",778,,,
Minnesota Jim,5,We all loved Krumbles. Please bring it back. - Jim in Minnesota,778,,,
Linda-6,5,I've been requesting that they bring back this cereal for years now and never hear a thing; PLEASE BRING BACK KRUMBLES!,778,,,
boomtudy,3,(Team Breakfast Member)  I never understood why they did away with Krumbles cereal. It was the best. Bring it back please!!!,778,,,
Bitsy,0,"Please bring back Krumbles! I always remember it being the best cereal. When we couldn't get in our state, my dad found a grocery store in Wisconsin that had it still. He bought all the boxes they had! Bring it back!",778,,,

Jon R.,5,"Besides Sir Grapefellow, this cereal was my absolute favorite!",778,,,
Motor Mouth,5,I too have been trying to find Krumbles on the cereal shelf! It was always my favorite cereal and I was very upset when the store where I shopped quit carrying it!! Little did I know it was no longer being made. Why not? Motor Mouth,778,,,
knotaclew,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Absolutely my favorite until the powers that be took it off the market. Please revamp your thinking, get rid of some sweet cereals and reintroduce Krumbles - Kellogg's best Munch the Krunch cereal!",778,,,
Helen,5,"I remember Krumbles being yummy in every way -- flavor, texture, crunch. Easily one of my all time favorites. Wish they would bring it back!",778,,,
Bill in IL,5,Krumbles needs to be brought back into production. In today's health conscious market the demand for the cereal would be significant. Missing a best friend.,778,,,
jeanbean,5,This was the best tasting cereal. Please bring it back.,778,,,
ceegee,5,Krumbles was also my favorite cereal from the time I was a child into the 1970s. I'd love to see it back.,778,,,
Glenda,5,"I just returned from a trip to Italy. I had what I would swear was Krumbles for breakfast! I stayed at a Westin Hotel in Rome and one in Venice, and they both had it. I wish I had gotten the name, but figured it would be Italian, and if available in the States, I'd be able to find ""Krumbles"" through Google. Sadly, I can't...",778,,,
Krumbles Please,5,"The Best Cereal I've ever eaten. I have not been able to find it for years. I wish it would return to the grocery store, to fill my breakfast needs once again. I might would even try to make it if I had an inkling how.",778,,,
need it,5,Grew up on it! Could find it into the mid-80's in Washington special foods shop. Bring it back!!!,778,,,
Coop,5,"I dream about Krumbles, its dark flavor after it's been in the milk a while, better than any other bran from anyone. I'd pay 20 bucks a box for it to come back.",778,,,
Farmer,5,I really liked this cereal. It was my favorite. Looked everywhere for it and then found out it is not made anymore. Wish they would bring it back for us older people who like a whole wheat cereal without the added sugar.,778,,,
It Was So Good,0,Bring back this wonderful cereal. My family enjoyed it very much and was disappointed when it was discontinued. We need the cereal back.,778,,,
Kate,5,I would also like to see a comeback of this cereal. It was also my favorite cereal growing up. Please bring it back Kelloggs!,778,,,
Dave,5,"I have seen a Kellogg's comment on a Canadian site that implied Krumbles was discontinued because Frosted Mini-Wheats filled the need for a shredded wheat-like cereal that would fit in a bowl without being crumbled up. Ridiculous! Apart from any competition with Nabisco Shredded Wheat, Krumbles was a tremendous cereal in its own right, with great taste and texture. The only ""old-folks cereal"" I would touch as a kid. I loved it until they killed it in 1972 (when I was 17). It would go great now that the boomers are becoming seniors!",778,,,
Krumbler,5,"This was my favorite cereal when I was growing up. My father's also. Is there ANY chance that it will ever be produced again? If so, put me down for several cases!!",778,,,

ThatGuy McFly,5,MY GAWD! This was the best one of the Monster ceereals... while it lasted anyways. Bring it back for Halloween 2019-2020!,402,,,
Cerealman,5,"If I remember correctly, it tasted like Froot Loops with marshmallows. You can get Froot Loops with marshmallows now, so yay!",402,,,
the-omega-man,3,Actually Yummy Mummy was fully endorsed and represented as the new monster in the monster cereal collection. All you need to do is look at the bottom flap of any early Yummy Mummy cereal box where it clearly states 'Monster Cereals'. My specific example is a series 5 box where it states Yummy Mummy is a Monster Cereal and the UPC code also says it is a Monster Cereal. Case closed!,402,,,
The Ritty,0,"Never had it, but I remember the commercials for it.",402,,,
Steve-Os,5,"Wow, I remember loving the original Yummy Mummy when I was a kid. Probably my favorite cereal memories are eating the Yummy Mummy cereal. I wish they would bring back the original formula/flavor. But the re-release of the Orange and Creme Yummy Mummy in 2013 was still pretty good. Not as good as the original though. Why do all of the good cereals have to be taken off the shelves?",402,,,
nonylworm,3,(Team Breakfast Member)  Okay cereal but really could use some more flavor. It seems kind of bland.,402,,,
Bucksky11,0,My local Walmart has two packs of all five monster cereals for $5.00!,402,,,
Postman,5,Found a box at Walgreen's. Not too bad. But I still prefer the oat based cereal. I can't find any of the monster cereals at Target or Wal Mart. Looked all over the store. Kmart has them though.,402,,,
Tray,5,FYM is back! It tastes just like I remember it so at least to me it is the original flavor.,402,,,
Bucksky11,0,"I would say that Yummy Mummy was definitely a monster cereal since Count Chocula and Franken Berry were in the commercial. By the way, both Fruity Yummy Mummy and Frute Brute have been re-released by General Mills for the 2013 Halloween Season. It's not the original recipes but still a fun trip down memory lane. Check Target for the retro boxes of all five monster cereals!",402,,,
Postman,5,Yummy Mummy is back this Halloween along with Fruit Brute. All 5 monster cereals together again. Now make them in the oat based form.,402,,,
Baltimore J.,5,"I would definitely buy a case of Yummy Mummy! It's tough for me to find any monster cereal where I live in Baltimore, MD.",402,,,
McFlyJr1979,5,Everyone thought I made this up... that I was nuts. Now I can prove Yummy Mummy was real. Thanks!,402,,,
ChewChew,4,I thought Fruit Brute tasted better than Yummy Mummy. I would buy both if they ever decided to release them.,402,,,
correction,5,General Mills absolutely DID say that Yummy Mummy WAS a Monster Cereal. Every box said so on the bottom flap 'Monster Cereal' and every box from series 1 thru 5 showed the other monsters introducing themselves on the back panel. Yummy Mummy is and always was a Monster Cereal.,402,,,

Uncle Mo,5,"Quake was it for me. I remember sending 50 cents and two box tops for the Jay Ward premium Quake helmet all those years ago. And like all kids, my mom threw it out when we moved to the burbs. I recall writing to Quaker oats asking to see if they could send me out another helmet to replace the 'lost' one. I got the sound of crickets back.",294,,,
T Krieger,0,"I think Quisp won out because it was seen as the 'underdog' of the rivalry, and people generally go for underdogs... (This is also why the Quake 'makeovers' didn't work.)",294,,,
Marco,0,I voted for Quake as I liked the character and cereal best. My best friend voted for Quisp and I was devastated that he won. I do recall seeing Quake re-issued briefly in the 1990s; it was on Phoenix grocery shelves.,294,,,
Tyler,5,I extremely like Quake cereal! Bring it back!,294,,,
The Slammer,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I have a dream, a wish, that Quake will come back. I loved it so much. Come on Quaker, bring it back!",294,,,
Butch,5,Loved Quake cereal. Bring it back.,294,,,
Ken,5,"I loved both Quake and Quisp. I wish that Quaker would bring them both back. As for the comment that Quake was reintroduced later as King Vitamin... the shape might have been the same, but the flavor was VERY different. I could not stand the taste of King Vitamin.",294,,,
ToolShedd,5,Originally preferred Quisp to Quake. New & Improved Quake was much tastier than Quisp! Bring back New Quake!,294,,,
Randall,0,"Quake did indeed disappear from the market altogether after the Quake Quangaroos cereal disappeared from store shelves. Later the cereal re-emerged from limbo but this time packaged under another brand label named 'King Vitaman.' Same cereal, same shape and size, different packaging. One of the television ads had this hook phrase: 'If you liked Quake, you'll love King Vitaman!""",294,,,
jojo,5,"Quake WAS crunchier! I liked 'em both. Recently, Quisp reappeared at my local market and I bought about 8 boxes. Bring back Quake!",294,,,
Rik,5,"I always favored Quake the character but liked the Quisp cereal. I voted for Quake and I also liked Quake cereal. Most of the old cartoon cereals are still on the shelf, but I really miss the Sat. am cartoons.",294,,,

dr. sivana,5,"I liked the Quake character so much, that I even ate Quangaroos when they replaced it. Bring back Quake!",294,,,
JackieO,0,"My brother loved Quake and I, of course, loved Quisp! I miss those old Saturday mornings in our footie pajamas.",294,,,
EdwardTom,5,I loved Quake! I hated that mean nasty Quisp! I was devastated when Quisp won and Quake was discontinued. Quake was magic to me; sitting there in a trance reading his cereal box and watching the commercials. I think if they would have made them (Quake and Quisp) into a Saturday cartoon on TV it would have been a hit with us then kids and made the cereals more popular and maybe Quake would still be here!!,294,,,
Jerry T,4,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I liked Quake better when he was an underground ""He-Man"" and not so much when they turned him in to a pencil armed Australian cowboy. I voted for Quake (the way he was). I liked the plastic Quake helmet better than the Quisp propeller hat. You could use the Quake helmet as a night light.",294,,,
Bullwinkle J,5,I liked both of them but Quake stayed crunchier in milk.,294,,,
Ageless Kid,0,I do remember that the Quake character differed in 1969 and the cereal sort of too. This character changed his look from an underground worker to a freckle-faced guy with cowboy hat and gloves.,294,,,
Poppins,5,Quisp and Quake... two cereals I loved... wish they'd make a come back...,294,,,
acupunk62,5,I was a Quake Fan and even had the rock collection (which also came with a rock hammer if I remember correctly). I was so disappointed when Quake lost the election!,294,,,
Mr EJ,5,"I was born in 1964, my older brother was born in 1962. That meant he always got to be Batman, and I always got stuck being Robin. I remember when the Quisp and Quake helmets came in the mail. Quisp had the cool electric propeller, I got stuck with the Quake helmet (where is it now!!!)",294,,,
joebacon,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  This was my favorite cereal as a kid. Every morning, I'd eat two big bowls of it. Yes, I still remember the Quisp/Quake ""election"" in 1972 and I voted for Quake every time I finished a box. Really disappointed when they discontinued it!",294,,,
quakefan,5,I voted for Quake over Quisp during the big election!,294,,,
eawk,5,"They need to bring Quake back, its hard to explain the wonderful taste of this cereal.",294,,,
miners hat,5,"I remember sending a certain amount of money with either box tops or proof of purchase seals to Quaker Oats for a Quake yellow miner's hard hat that had a working flashlight. And if memory serves me well, I believe that I liked Quake cereal better than Cap'n Crunch.",294,,,
lakeview,5,Quake was better than Quisp! Am I the only one who voted for Quake? Grumble.,294,,,
owen1,0,(Team Breakfast Member) Bring Quake back! Bring Quake back!,294,,,
Flint,5,"Love it! I love Quisp better, but it's nice to see Quake now and again. Bring them both back! Quaker are you listening?",294,,,
GloballyWarmed,5,"The Quisp character is cuter, but Quake was my all time favorite cereal... it tasted as good as quisp and stayed cronchy longer. The only things close are Captain Crunch or King Vitamin. I'm going to try mixing Captain crunch and Quisp. Freakies were good too...",294,,,
Dave S,5,I liked Quake better than Quisp.,294,,,

Ernie,5,"I remember having Quangaroos back in the day, but I don't ever recall eating Quisp. Our ShopRite sells it and I decided to check it out. Tastes like a buttery version of Cap'n Crunch. This seems to be a favored cereal for a good reason.",300,,,
PlatNuMonk,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Since they stopped making Freakies, this cereal was bumped up on list to",300,,,
Postman,5,"I have been buying all my daughters friends a box of Quisp to try. They all love it. It appears to be really selling well at my local Food City.

Crunch-14,5,"Best cereal ever IMHO. Couldn't believe it when my daughter found Quisp at a Shoprite in the town next to us. I went over today and bought four boxes! Hope it stays on the shelf. As to comparisons to Cap'n Crunch, the two are similar, but Quisp does not seem so excessively sweet.",300,,,
Tyler,2,Quisp gives me gas! I have to go to the bathroom immediately after I eat it.,300,,,
Shack,5,"Awesome cereal. We ate more of this cereal than my kids ever did of Cap'n Crunch and Cheerios combined. If I can find it reasonable, I will buy some.",300,,,

It's almost impossible to find in East Tennessee though; so far I can only find it online at Walmart.com, and last I looked they only sold it by the case. Does anybody know if Publix or Aldi carry it? I haven't checked those yet...",300,,,
Quisp Dude,5,This cereal was / is AWESOME! I grew up eating it. Hard to find these days!,300,,,
jim-11,5,Possibly my favorite cereal ever.,300,,,

I was so surprised to see it at National Liquidater in Weymouth, Mass this past weekend. I bought all three boxes at $4.00 a box. Please bring it back to all stores. We love it still!",300,,,
carolanne,5,I've been eating this cereal since I was 3 years old and I am now 52! I love this cereal and Quisp is the coolest and cutest alien ever! I hope Quaker never stops making Quisp.,300,,,

Love Dat Quisp,4,Quisp can be purchased at the Woodmans supermarkets in Wisconsin.,300,,,
Shane,5,I ate this cereal with my mom in the 80's. My mom said it was her favorite as a kid. I lost my mom in 94 and I would give anything to be able to share a bowl of Quisp with my kids now :-(,300,,,
Randall,5,"Quaker Oats has made this cereal available again as of 2014. You can buy directly from their store (8.5 ounce box) or from Amazon.com. In Bloomington, Indiana, you can purchase a 8.5 ounce box of this cereal as well at Marsh Supermarkets. Or, if you have a lot of money to burn, you can order at 12 pack case from Walmart for about $60.00 US. Enjoy!",300,,,
M. Mouth,5,Quisp brings back great memories from my childhood of having the roof of my mouth torn to shreds from the cereal before the milk had a chance to turn it into a nice mucus texture. Great stuff.,300,,,

PA Cereal Lover,5,Giant Market in Pennsylvania had this cereal when it made its comeback. I'm glad they brought it back; this is one of my favorites when I was little in the early 70s (possibly around 1971 and 1972).,300,,,
volunteer,5,Spotted a single box last night at a food pantry where I volunteer. Total blast from the past! Always voted for Quisp over Quake.,300,,,
K.C.,5,"Quisp is becoming more common in supermarkets in the northeast. Ironically, you usually don't find it in the cereal aisle. It most frequently appears in a temporary small cardboard display that is placed in an aisle or end of aisle. I've seem it in the bread section in A&P stores and oddly enough the frozen food aisle of Shop Rite. This is rather strange... I don't understand, if they are going through the trouble of shipping it to stores why not just put in back on the cereal shelf where it belongs!",300,,,
Funnydan,5,They sell boxes of Quisp at the Marc's stores in Ohio. I buy it all the time.,300,,,
rumpus,5,I love Quisp. My favorite memories are watching Rocky and Bullwinkle with a big bowl in my lap.,300,,,
lindamim,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I was 4 years old in 1965 and was so totally hooked on my Quisp! I was so into Quisp that I had the cloth doll, and can't remember what happened to it. Sure wonder now, how much it would be worth today. I, for one, would love to find some... I would still buy it.",300,,,
Quisp-Lover,0,"I got you all beat. I found Quisp in Kahului Maui, Hawaii just last month with a red tag on it for 89 cents. I only bought 4 boxes, but should have bought all 20 of them. I sent a box to my sister in Switzerland. We grew up on that tasty morning treat. It was as good as ever... not suffering the same fate as the altered-ingredient facelift that Cap'n Crunch endured. The boxes of Quisp were on a mark down because no one here knew what it was. Anyone willing to send a few boxes to me in Hawaii? If so, contact me at marcantosch@hotmail.com. Aloha!",300,,,
Postman,5,"When looking at my box of Quisp that I bought, Quaker Oats has reduced the size from 9oz to 8.5oz. I am just glad to have my Quisp. BTW... I found Quisp at Fresh Market.",300,,,
Scrapple Man,5,Fresh Market in Baltimore has it! I'm so glad.,300,,,
dmh,4,"In central NJ, it's (strangely) available at Shoprite all of the sudden. Loved this cereal as a kid. Have to admit that after eating 1/4 box it left a weird after-taste. If it was a wine, I'd say it had a bad finish. :-)",300,,,
Great Memories,5,My grandfather owned a store and I remember in 1965 (I was small) that I liked both Quisp and Quake. My mother hated the brand because we were bouncing off the walls 3 hours after! I bought some at Ocean state job lot and it's just as great!,300,,,
Joel,5,"People, you can buy it on Amazon.",300,,,
bergie,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  Where can I find Quisp in Minnesota? I love the stuff. It would bring back a lot of memories. It's all I would eat for breakfast when I was a kid.,300,,,
Postman,5,I found Quisp at Fresh Market for $2.99. My daughter and I devoured a box for breakfast. My son started on the second box this morning.,300,,,
stewie1011,5,"I loved this cereal both as a kid and even now as an adult. My two brothers, my sister and I grew up on it. Wish I could find it more often though. My sister bought me a box last year for my birthday as she found it in Target. But we haven't come across it since.",300,,,
Iceman09,5,"If you live near Atlanta, Quisp is available now at Fresh Market. Just bought 4 boxes today.",300,,,
Ricky D,5,"I was buying Quisp at Walmart.com, but I can't find it now. Please tell me how to get it at Walmart again. I love it.",300,,,
love Quisp!!!,5,I love this cereal!!! I want it to come back into regular stores. I found it at a dollar store some years back and bought up all they had on the shelf. Great memories. My kids love it too. Shouldn't generations be saying something? This should be back on the shelves in regular stores!,300,,,
McGonigal,5,"I loved the cereal when I was a kid. I see that some people have been able to find it, but I haven't seen it in many, many years. I miss it so much.",300,,,
mwarneridx,5,"I ate Quisp almost every morning as a kid... can't say it made me grow up big & strong, necessarily, but I sure loved it...",300,,,
harrymorgan,5,It's so lame that you can't you find Quisp on the the regular grocery store shelves. So unfair!,300,,,
Postman,5,"Mr. Breakfast I have seen massive amounts of votes given in one day to Frosted Flakes, Captain Crunch and Honey Nut Cheerios. They are never penalized. I only vote once a day for Quisp and yet you only seem to target Quisp for penalties when it is obvious the others are having multiple votes also. Note From Mr Breakfast:: Thanks for the comment Postman. I'll keep an eye on those. Whenever there's dramatic moves in the list, I check the unique visitors to a page against the number of votes. Sometimes, a cereal gets attention on Twitter, Facebook, etc and the increase is fair. Sometimes not. Those cereals will get votes removed if something funky is going on. BTW... love your comments throughout the site. Thanks!",300,,,
Quisp322,5,"4 boxes baby... got them right at my local Waldbaums for 10 bucks! I was blown away when my wife picked up a box all the way at the top of the shelf and was like ""Oh I remember these... Quisp!"" I immediately ran and took all the boxes left.",300,,,
MoonRockRing,5,"Hey ""Stevenp"", I totally remember the Moon Rocks... just read a story on Yahoo Newz saying that 'selling' of any Apollo Moon Rocks was illegal...",300,,,
Dee Dee,5,I love Quisp cereal - always have and always will!!!,300,,,
Postman,5,"My wife found Quisp at Fresh Market. Mr. Breakfast, what happened to the votes? Everything appears to be lost since June.",300,,,
packageman,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  QUISP is simply the best cereal ever!! I enjoyed it as a kid and still enjoy it today, if I can ever find it. I found some on clearance at Target and bought 9 boxes so my son, step daughter, daughter in law and grandson can try this delicious breakfast treat. 5 beans all the way!!",300,,,
quisp2011,5,I just got a box at Target. It's tasty and very similar to Cap'n Crunch only better because it is easier on your palate.,300,,,
QuispCrazy,5,"I've tried to tell people about this cereal for over 40 years now and no one knew what I was talking about. I went to Target today and was blown away that they had it on the shelf. Natch, I bought a box!! Love that they brought it back!",300,,,
stevenp,5,"I can't find mention of it anywhere, but someone HAS to remember the Quisp moon rock ring that had a ""genuine moon rock"" under a clear plastic dome! Anybody?",300,,,
Team QUAKE!!,1,"1968. I voted for Quake, my two year younger sister voted for Quisp. I still stand on my vote. Quake is better!",300,,,
Grewup70s,5,QUISP IS BACK!!!! Just bought three boxes at a Stop and Shop in RI this weekend!,300,,,
ken,0,"I was so happy when Quisp was back. When I flew to Chicago to visit the area, I spotted the cereal on the on the shelf at the supermarket near my hotel (and was I surprised). I brought it to my home in Alabama.",300,,,
kirbymom,0,"Great article but you misspell the word its over and over.. it's means it is. You want the word its, meaning belonging to it.",300,,,
kissy,0,Fun and delicious! And it's so obvious that people still love it just looking at the comments here. Come on Quaker... make this one more available. Please!,300,,,
P.U.R.E.,5,Quisp is greatest! I come here and vote for it once every day. I also loved Quake and Quangaroos. Those were the days.,300,,,
Pauly B.,5,Quisp is the best cereal ever! Takes me back to my childhood days whenever I see it.,300,,,
Postman,5,It sounds like Quisp is getting popular again. It is still at Food Lion. They just got a new shipment in. I wish the expiration dates were further out though.,300,,,
j.j.,5,Quisp is now available at Super Target stores! There's a Quisp t-shirt offer on the box too!,300,,,
boomaur,5,I love Quisp. I think it's the best cereal ever. It seems from here that it is popular. So... why is it so hard to find. Unfair!,300,,,
lava,5,I just found Quisp at Tops Market!,300,,,
Postman,5,I saw Quisp at Food Lion. I gave a box to my brother and sister for their birthdays. They loved it!,300,,,
mike,0,I have a Quisp ring. It looks to be made out of tin. I would think it has him on it holding a small red gun. Can anyone tell me what year this is from. Please email me at bigmike7898@yahoo.com,300,,,
eaglesnut10,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  Very fondly remember both this cereal and its counter-part, QUAKE. I remember as a kid sending away for the Quisp bank. It got damaged in shipping, so I sent it back. The second one came, but it, too, had been damaged during shipping. I remember my mother being really mad for some reason. I couldn't have been more than 10 years old back then...",300,,,
quisp and life,5,"(Team Breakfast Member)  I let my Quisp soak in milk till it gets soft, my palate can't handle the crunch that it could as a kid so I eat it this way instead and it is still awesome!!!!!!!! I rate this 5 beanies with propellers too!",300,,,
javaman,0,This cereal is the best tasting breakfast I ever remembered. I am still looking for the flying saucer toy that was in the cereal prize.,300,,,
Quispy,5,I think most people enjoy the character but love the taste of the cereal. I don't think people would eat it if they did not like the taste.,300,,,
wackers,2,"I'm sorry, but I think Quisp kind of sucks. It's very boring compared to Cap'n Crunch or another cereal with more flavor and crunch. People like the character and brainwash themselves that the cereal tastes good.",300,,,
Hub Loves It,5,Quisp is the only cereal my husband will eat. The last time we found it was at Dollar General a few years ago. Would like to find a store that sells it.,300,,,
Quispy,5,I have found Quisp at Food Lion for $2.99 a box. It was even featured in one of their weekly ads. My kids and I have already gone through about 5 boxes. We still have 3 boxes in the pantry. My wife does not like it quite as much as we do.,300,,,
micki,4,I really love this cereal. I used to eat it as a kid.,300,,,
Casandra,5,(Team Breakfast Member)  I LOVE this stuff! I remember they remarketed it in a bag under a different name. I called the 800,300,,,
planno,5,Quisp and Quake were fun. Cereal were so much more fun in the 70's. Imagine being a kid then and the cereal section was like the toy section. Takes me back.,300,,,
Quispy Memories,5,My mom was a health cereal nut when I was growing up. I was born in 1962 and I remember the ads for Quisp and Quake but only got to enjoy them at my cousins house - my aunt was more lenient. I did find Quisp in a little mom and pop store in the early eighties in PA. and now enjoy them again.,300,,,
nana,5,I really loved Quisp cereal and was really disappointed when I could no longer buy it at the store. I wish I knew where to get it so I can introduce it to my children and my grandson. I'm 45 and really miss the great taste.,300,,,
WJ,5,"I loved this cereal as a kid. I actually had the cosmic clouder gun like the one pictured. From what I remember, you loaded it with baby powder and it shot the powder out in a cloud of ""smoke"". Can't remember what happened to it. Glad to see that Quisp is back. My wife recently found it on the shelves at a Fresh Market grocery store.",300,,,
Quisplovechild,5,This is the best breakfast cereal of all times. I am 44 years old and my best cereal moments are of Quisp. When I was carrying my youngest now 13 I ate Quisp day and night it was the only food I could keep down. My brothers and I still exchange it for gifts.,300,,,
